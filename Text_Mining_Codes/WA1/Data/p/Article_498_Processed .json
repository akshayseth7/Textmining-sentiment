We are in the midst of re-evaluating our lease rules to provide yellow drivers with this kind of flexibility.\\n\\nGus Kodogiannis, who opened McGuinness Management almost 30 years ago, said: Honestly, yes, its Uber. Weve lost 40% of our business in the last year and a half.\\n\\nUber waged a public battle against New York City mayor Bill de Blasio last month after he proposed a bill to limit the growth of for-hire vehicle companies such as Uber and Lyft.\\n\\nTo fight the proposed legislation, Uber pulled no punches. The company, which has a history of being far from conflict-averse, aggressively marketed itself as a service for minorities and outer-borough residents (two groups taxis are notoriously bad at serving) and as a means for New Yorkers to find gainful employment.\\n\\nNew York City is one of Ubers largest markets; the company generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue there.\\n\\nYou
