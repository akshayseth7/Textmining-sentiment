In 2001, this happened one day after the boundaries report was issued, and in 2011, one month and 26 days.\\n\\nNomination Day must take place no earlier than five days and no later than one month after the writ is issued. Nomination Day is the start of the campaign period, which is required by law to be a minimum of nine days.\\n\\nThere is then a Cooling-Off Day, which falls on the eve of Polling Day when voters cast
