"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz released a video titled In Defense of Religious Liberty. Cruz interviews Dick and Betty Odgaard, who own a wedding venue called the Gortz Haus Gallery in Iowa and refuse to serve same-sex couples. He informs the couple that their decision to turn away gay customers inspires me. The video ends with an invitation to an upcoming Iowa rally for religious libertyhosted by Cruz, of course.\\n\\nA few corrections. First, the Gortz Haus Gallery is not a church, as Cruz repeatedly labels it. The gallery was a church, but when the Odgaards bought it, they converted it from a house of worship into a bistro, flower shop, art gallery, and wedding venuein other words, a business. Second, the video strongly implies that the Odgaards business was forced to stop hosting all weddings because the state fined it into oblivion. That is not true. The Iowa Civil Rights Commissioned fined the Odgaards just $5,000and insisted that they must stop refusing service to same-sex couples. It was the latter ruling by which the Odgaards could not abide. Betty Odgaard says the gallery stopped hosting weddings because we didnt have a choice. In fact, the gallery stopped hosting weddings because the Odgaards couldnt bear to serve gay and bisexual clientele.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"andrew\"],
