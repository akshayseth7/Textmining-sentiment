"{\"Text\": \"Here at ReviewTrackers, we work every day with businesses to help them embrace the power of online reviews  even if those reviews arent necessarily always positive.\\n\\nThats why, in situations where your business has received a one-star rating or a scathing review on sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, we strongly believe in the conversation-changing power of a professional, polite, and timely response. After all, even the most vocal or critical of customers can be won over if your business shows how much it values their feedback.\\n\\nThis doesnt take away the fact that bad reviews can hurt. In recent cases, weve seen business owners fight back against those who have given them negative, one-star reviews. The question is: is it worth the battle? And what weighs more heavily: a business ability to have the last say and defend itself from criticism, or its ability to extinguish fires and prevent long-term damage to reputation? Lets check out some extreme examples:\\n\\nPark Italian Gourmet\\n\\nPark Italian Gourmet in New York is owned by Francesco Macri, who is actually terrific at responding to positive reviews. Hes kind, humble, grateful, and , if necessary, apologetic  always thanking people for compliment-filled reviews and promising customers hell do better in lieu of a bad day.\\n\\nBut in the face of scathing reviews, Macri isnt afraid of telling Yelpers that theyre idiots, or theyre full of s**t. Check out some of the responses he has written to one- or two-star reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nThe second response, by the way, translates to Youre such an idiot. Youre in Brooklyn, please.\\n\\nTsk, tsk. Not good! Theres another critical review to which Macri responds, There is an overall douche-baggery to your review that makes me unsympathetic, and ultimately content that you didnt have a good experience.\\n\\nGaia Italian Cafe\\n\\nGaia Italian Cafe, also in New York, actually receives great, mostly 4- or 5-star reviews on Yelp, where the establishment has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 500 reviews (and counting). The occasional negative review Gaia does receive is typically not received warmly.\\n\\nALSO check out: How NOT to Respond to Online Reviews (or How to Get People to Hate Your Business)\\n\\nAfter someone complained about overcooked pasta, owner Gaia Bagnasacco wrote, Where are the educated customers? Where are the people who understand quality and what we are doing? Here are a few more Im fighting back responses:\\n\\nAlden & Harlow\\n\\nYou might have heard about this story earlier this month, wherein Chef Michael Scelfo of Alden & Harlow took to Instagram to shame a couple of entitled, insulting Yelpers. Scelfo explained the situation in the caption of his Instagram post, which has since been deleted:\\n\\nWe tried to have them leave, they refused. Taking their drink away and being forceful is not hospitable. So in lieu of calling the police (only other recourse imo) which seemed [too] strong a response, we opted to kill them with kindness until they left. ... My choice to post this is not to slander them per [se] but to call attention to a major flaw in the current online review system & entitled mentality. Ultimately, its about protecting the integrity of our (well documented) humble and gracious staff. Feel free to vilify me for posting, but I stand by my post.\\n\\nThe Instagram post came with the hashtag #wedontnegotiatewithyelpers.\\n\\nEveryone is calling Chef Scelfo a hero. One reader commented, Entitled jerks who treat the staff like garbage need to be called out more often, especially in the restaurant industry. Too often these people get away with this horrible behavior by making threats, but its time to let people know that the customer is not always right and you cant get whatever you want by being a demanding little brat.\\n\\nAnother one said, I want those two jokers or whoever the real culprits are banned from Yelp!\\n\\nIs it worth fighting back?\\n\\nWhile some consumers will continue to encourage responses such as the ones Macri, Bagnasacco, and Scelfo have posted  after all, its simply a case of business owners fighting back against abusive customers  industry experts believe that businesses ought to respond in ways that are less vengeful and more diplomatic.\\n\\nWhen a business owner behaves this way with customers, rather than vice versa, the power dynamic shifts, wrote the Boston Globes Devra First. There are other ways to rectify the situation. For instance, had the women carried through with a bad Yelp review (it doesnt appear they did), the restaurant might have gone to the site and posted a reply in kind.\\n\\nA restaurant being rated is a business, an organization. An individual being rated is a person.\\n\\nAdded a Daily Mail reader: In reading reviews, I know there are always people who wont be happy about their meals, but I still may go. If I read a rant by a chef or owner against a poster....I will NEVER go to that business, for fear what they might do to meals they prepare.\\n\\nAnd from an Eater reader: The measure of a great chef is not how they handle the good guests, but how they handle the bad ones.\\n\\nIndeed. At the end of the day, the more significant impact on the bottom line will be made by the way a business responds to feedback  and not what one or two hard-to-please customers have said on the Internet. So, the next time you receive an unfair one-star review and feel like lashing out, remember that, while you have the right to defend your business, there is hardly anything positive that will come out of criticizing customers.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about how to more effectively manage online reviews and build your online reputation, give us a call and our friendly team will show you how to get started.

to reputation Lets check out some extreme examples\\n\\nPark Italian Gourmet\\n\\nPark Italian Gourmet in New York is owned by Francesco Macri who is actually terrific at responding to positive reviews Hes kind humble grateful and  if necessary apologetic  always thanking people for complimentfilled reviews and promising customers hell do better in lieu of a bad day\\n\\nBut in the face of scathing reviews Macri isnt afraid of telling Yelpers that theyre idiots or theyre full of st Check out some of the responses he has written to one or twostar reviews on Yelp\\n\\nThe second response by the way translates to Youre such an idiot Youre in Brooklyn please\\n\\nTsk tsk Not good Theres another critical review to which Macri responds There is an overall douchebaggery to your review that makes me unsympathetic and ultimately content that you didnt have a good experience\\n\\nGaia Italian Cafe\\n\\nGaia Italian Cafe also in New York actually receives great mostly 4 or 5star reviews on Yelp where the establishment has an average rating of 45 out of 5 stars with 500 reviews and counting The occasional negative review Gaia does receive is typically not received warmly\\n\\nALSO check out How NOT to Respond to Online Reviews or How to Get People to Hate Your Business\\n\\nAfter someone complained about overcooked pasta owner Gaia Bagnasacco wrote Where are the educated customers Where are the people who understand quality and what we are doing Here are a few more Im fighting back responses\\n\\nAlden  Harlow\\n\\nYou might have heard about this story earlier this month wherein Chef Michael Scelfo of Alden  Harlow took to Instagram to shame a couple of entitled insulting Yelpers Scelfo explained the situation in the caption of his Instagram post which has since been deleted\\n\\nWe tried to have them leave they refused Taking their drink away and being forceful is not hospitable So in lieu of calling the police only other recourse imo which seemed too strong a response we opted to kill them with kindness until they left  My choice to post this is not to slander them per se but to call attention to a major flaw in the current online review system  entitled mentality Ultimately its about protecting the integrity of our well documented humble and gracious staff Feel free to vilify me for posting but I stand by my post\\n\\nThe Instagram post came with the hashtag wedontnegotiatewithyelpers\\n\\nEveryone is calling Chef Scelfo a hero One reader commented Entitled jerks who treat the staff like garbage need to be called out more often especially in the restaurant industry Too often these people get away with this horrible behavior by making threats but its time to let people know that the customer is not always right and you cant get whatever you want by being a demanding little brat\\n\\nAnother one said I want those two jokers or whoever the real culprits are banned from Yelp\\n\\nIs it worth fighting back\\n\\nWhile some consumers will continue to encourage responses such as the ones Macri Bagnasacco and Scelfo have posted  after all its simply a case of business owners fighting back against abusive customers  industry experts believe that businesses ought to respond in ways that are less vengeful and more diplomatic\\n\\nWhen a business owner behaves this way with customers rather than vice versa the power dynamic shifts wrote the Boston Globes Devra First There are other ways to rectify the situation For instance had the women carried through with a bad Yelp review it doesnt appear they did the restaurant might have gone to the site and posted a reply in kind\\n\\nA restaurant being rated is a business an organization An individual being rated is a person\\n\\nAdded a Daily Mail reader In reading reviews I know there are always people who wont be happy about their meals but I still may go If I read a rant by a chef or owner against a posterI will NEVER go to that business for fear what they might do to meals they prepare\\n\\nAnd from an Eater reader The measure of a great chef is not how they handle the good guests but how they handle the bad ones\\n\\nIndeed At the end of the day the more significant impact on the bottom line will be made by the way a business responds to feedback  and not what one or two hardtoplease customers have said on the Internet So the next time you receive an unfair onestar review and feel like lashing out remember that while you have the right to defend your business there is hardly anything positive that will come out of criticizing customers\\n\\nIf you have
