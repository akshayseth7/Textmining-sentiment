"{\"Text\": \"I think [what] this movement is doing is trying to do things people think are more politically feasible. Well, the reality is that we really need to start expanding our view of who we will ascribe opportunities for redemption to. Not just to these so-called nonviolent prisoners, but all prisoners who are worthy of redemption. So, Im one that has been talking about this issue for some time, this failure to include so-called violent offenders.\\n\\nYeah, well, I have a problem with that. Ive spoken out about it a lotthat youre not gonna solve this problem until we start having a real conversation about so-called violent offenders.\\n\\nThe other thing I hear people worry about a lot is that the legislation thats been proposed by Congress so far is all geared exclusively toward nonviolent offenders. Why is that?\\n\\nYeah. The same way that this idea of mass incarceration went viral throughout our society in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, there needs to be a similar movement back to some rationality and pragmatism. So what were doing at the federal level is really important.\\n\\nSo you see it as a two-way street, where the states are inspiring the federal government to act, and the federal government will inspire other states that havent moved on this?\\n\\nFirst of allmove the needle? For the guy who doesnt spend 50 years in prison for a nonviolent offense, that moves the needle a lot for his life. But also, we live in a nation where, when New Jersey figures out how to do something and does it well, and shows progress, it affects other states. When I was mayor I looked at other cities for innovations and reforms. And so for the federal government to make moves on solitary confinement, make moves on reducing mandatory minimums and three-strikes laws, that makes a big impact on thousands of Americans. But it also will have an impact, I think, on a lot of states as well.\\n\\nThere are relatively few prisoners in the federal system. Would any of the federal legislation people are talking about really move the needle, even if there was comprehensive reform passed?\\n\\nWell, look, I think its really noble for organizations like Cut50 to put specific numbers out there. I just dont think theres any reason for the United States to be so out of step with our industrial peers, and for us as a society to be heaping this self-imposed burden on us that drags our economy, reduces productivity for such a large percentage of our citizenry, that drives poverty. I have never articulated a specific number, but I think a nation as great as we are, that professes to favor freedom and liberty, that we would find a way to evidence that in our criminal justice system by achieving what we know we can achieve: a reduction in crime, a reduction in taxpayer expense, and a reduction in the prison population.\\n\\nWhen you look at the total number of people who are behind bars in Americaits about 1.5 million in state prisons , about 200,000 or so in federal prisons , and about 700,000 in local jails on any given dayhow much do you want to reduce those numbers? Do you have a goal in mind that you think is realistic?\\n\\nI dont want to talk about anything being negotiated. But obviously there are pieces of legislation already out there that I think are important, like the Smarter Sentencing Act. You know, mandatory minimums, three-strikes-and-youre-out lawsall those front-end policies that we have, that have been such a major source of our mass incarceration problem, need to be addressed. There are other aspects of reform that are just as criticalmany of which are [bills] that Ive either proposed or co-sponsored: everything from the elimination of procedures like solitary confinement, which many people consider torture, all the way to helping people to reintegrate, so we dont have such a stunningly high recidivism rate nationally as we do.\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker: Well, look, theres a lot of great energy thats building in Washington, as you know. There is, on the House side, a piece of legislation thats already been introduced, that has a lot of good elements to it, and there is a lot of work here in the Senateconversations Im involved inabout trying to get a piece of solid legislation sometime in the coming months. So, Im hopeful. Obviously its not moving as fast as I would like. And a lot of the efforts are great steps but not as comprehensive as I would like. But I just feel grateful that theres a bipartisan coalition trying to get something done in this Congress.\\n\\nLeon Neyfakh: Weve been hearing for many months now that were going to see criminal justice reform soon. From where youre sitting, do you have a sense of when it might actually happen?\\n\\nOne exception is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, whom I spoke to by phone on Friday. During our conversation, Booker expressed unequivocal support for a position that has not yet become popular with his colleagues in Washington: If the United States is serious about ending mass incarceration, it will require more than just lenience for drug offenders and other low-level criminals.\\n\\nThere are two big reasons for this. The first is that the proposed legislation would only apply to the federal prison system, which houses just 10 percent of the nations inmates. The second is that, of the more than 1.5 million people in state prisons, about half are there because theyve been convicted of violent offenses like murder, rape, and armed robbery. Most politicians dont have the stomach to talk about reducing sentences for violent offenders.\\n\\nThe emerging consensus has created the impression that reform is around the cornerand it might very well be. But none of the proposed legislation thats currently on the table can be expected to shrink the prison population by all that much .\\n\\nBeing in favor of criminal justice reform these days is fashionable in Washington. Politicians from the left and the right seem to agree that with 2.2 million people either in federal prison, state prison, or jail, the United States is keeping a shameful percentage of its population behind bars.\\n\\nAt the big Bipartisan Criminal Justice Summit in D.C. a couple of months back, you said something like, We need to redefine what it means to commit a violent crime. Can you elaborate on that? Some people might think the line between violent and nonviolent would be straightforward. Why isnt it?\\n\\nIts just not. I mean, weve lumped a lot of things [into the violent category] accomplices to crimes, robberies that often dont involve physical violence. But I think we need to look at the totality of the things that were labeling as violent and really examine whether we need to have some more proportionality in terms of the punishment fitting the crime thats done. The bright line that we have right now, between violent and nonviolent, does not account for shades of gray.\\n\\nDo you make this argument when you talk to other legislators?\\n\\nIts definitely been part of my conversations. But frankly as of now its not going that far.\\n\\nWhat kind of reaction do you get?\\n\\nLets just say the appetite is not there at this point for expanding that. There are still battles being fought over basic criminal justice reform for so-called nonviolent offenders.\\n\\nDo you see it as a question of incremental progress, where reform for nonviolent offenders will open up the political space for bigger, broader measures later?\\n\\nThats my hope. I hope that as we start putting points on the board for fiscal responsibility when it comes to criminal justice, and for justice, for proportionality, for fairness, we can expand after that to this gray area where we have people labeled as violent offenders but werent directly involved in acts of significant violence. So my hope is that once we get some momentum, well be able to address a much larger pool of people.\\n\\nOne concern Ive heard from activists and academics is that theres a conventional wisdom forming that the reason our prison population is so huge is because of nonviolent offenders. Even President Obama, during his big criminal justice speech in July, said, Over the last few decades weve also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before, for longer than ever before, and that is the real reason our prison population is so high. When I heard that, I just thought, Thats not true.\\n\\nWell, look, the drug war certainly has driven an explosion in incarceration, and drug crimes do make up a very large percentage of what we have. But again, weve been doling out harsher and harsher penalties for all crimes.\\n\\nIve seen research that says only 17 percent of the inmates in state prisons are there for drug charges. Just 17 percent! Whereas 50 percent or so are there for crimes that are classified as violent. Does that mean talking about the problem in the way Congress has been talking about it puts a pretty low ceiling on how much of a reduction in the prison population we can achieve?\\n\\nRight, but theres some other data that we should talk about. Michelle Alexander [author of The New Jim Crow] talks about how much marijuana arrests have fueled the explosion in arrests in our country. Her point is that we end up sending so many young people, particularly young African-Americans and Latinos, into the system. And what happens once you get a felony conviction? Now you are entering this American caste system where you cant get a job, you cant get a loan, you cant get a Pell grant, you cant get public housing. And then those people often feel that they have no other options, so they go back and commit crime again. And again, and again. And what we saw in Newark, through a Rutgers study, was that about 84 percent of our murder victims had been arrested before an average of 10 times.\\n\\nVictims?\\n\\nVictims. So what Im saying is that, because of these low-level drug crimes, people get stuck in this world that eventually turns violent. So Im very concerned about how were treating the drug war. And while I definitely want to deal with a more expansive view of who should be eligible for a lot of this legislation, please understand that the drug war has really fueled so much of our problem. The drug war has been a war where the direct casualties have primarily been Americas poor; Americas minorities; and often, unfortunately, Americas vulnerable, in terms of people with disease and addiction and mental health.\\n\\nThere is some debate around the Michelle Alexander bookthere are people who say she overstates the role of the drug war in the mass incarceration boom. And there is data that says the percentage of drug offenders in the prison population peaked in like, 1990, at 22 percent. So even when it was at the highest it has ever been, 4 out of 5 people in prison were there for offenses that didnt involve drugs. Thats something I hear from folks who are worried that the focus is too much on drug crimes right now.\\n\\nI guess Im not into the tyranny of the or either this or that. This system is broken along many, many dimensions. And to ignore the crisis of Americas drug policies and the devastating impact its having in America is a very significant problem. Thats not to say theres not a problem with high mandatory minimums as a wholewhich have shifted our whole criminal justice system from courts and judges to prosecutorial discretion. But the situation is bad all over.\\n\\nAs you said earlier, its politically quite difficult to get lawmakers to look at the entire situation, which would mean looking at people who are in prison for doing objectively bad things. Thats a high barrier for a lot of people, because intuitively theres a pretty powerful argument to be made that the central purpose of prison is to keep violent offenders out of society. But when you look at the data, it seems like its an argument that will have to be prevailed upon if were ever going to see a really serious drop in the incarceration numbers.\\n\\nI agree. I agree. Theres a profound, glaring injustice thats a significant part of our society that needs to be addressed.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"think\", \"movement\"], [\"movement\", \"trying\"], [\"trying\",

entire situation would mean looking people prison objectively bad thing thats high barrier lot people intuitively there pretty powerful argument made central purpose prison keep violent offender society look data seems like argument prevailed upon ever going see really serious drop incarceration number agree agree there profound glaring injustice thats significant part society need addressed\", \"Text_Lower\": \"i think what this movement is doing is trying to do things people think are more politically feasible well the reality is that we really need to start expanding our view of who we will ascribe opportunities for redemption to not just to these socalled nonviolent prisoners but all prisoners who are worthy of redemption so im one that has been talking about this issue for some time this failure to include socalled violent offenders\\n\\nyeah well i have a problem with that ive spoken out about it a lotthat youre not gonna solve this problem until we start having a real conversation about socalled violent offenders\\n\\nthe other thing i hear people worry about a lot is that the legislation thats been proposed by congress so far is all geared exclusively toward nonviolent offenders why is that\\n\\nyeah the same way that this idea of mass incarceration went viral throughout our society in the 70s 80s and 90s there needs to be a similar movement back to some rationality and pragmatism so what were doing at the federal level is really important\\n\\nso you see it as a twoway street where the states are inspiring the federal government to act and the federal government will inspire other states that havent moved on this\\n\\nfirst of allmove the needle for the guy who doesnt spend 50 years in prison for a nonviolent offense that moves the needle a lot for his life but also we live in a nation where when new jersey figures out how to do something and does it well and shows progress it affects other states when i was mayor i looked at other cities for innovations and reforms and so for the federal government to make moves on solitary confinement make moves on reducing mandatory minimums and threestrikes laws that makes a big impact on thousands of americans but it also will have an impact i think on a lot of states as well\\n\\nthere are relatively few prisoners in the federal system would any of the federal legislation people are talking about really move the needle even if there was comprehensive reform passed\\n\\nwell look i think its really noble for organizations like cut50 to put specific numbers out there i just dont think theres any reason for the united states to be so out of step with our industrial peers and for us as a society to be heaping this selfimposed burden on us that drags our economy reduces productivity for such a large percentage of our citizenry that drives poverty i have never articulated a specific number but i think a nation as great as we are that professes to favor freedom and liberty that we would find a way to evidence that in our criminal justice system by achieving what we know we can achieve a reduction in crime a reduction in taxpayer expense and a reduction in the prison population\\n\\nwhen you look at the total number of people who are behind bars in americaits about 15 million in state prisons  about 200000 or so in federal prisons  and about 700000 in local jails on any given dayhow much do you want to reduce those numbers do you have a goal in mind that you think is realistic\\n\\ni dont want to talk about anything being negotiated but obviously there are pieces of legislation already out there that i think are important like the smarter sentencing act you know mandatory minimums threestrikesandyoureout lawsall those frontend policies that we have that have been such a major source of our mass incarceration problem need to be addressed there are other aspects of reform that are just as criticalmany of which are bills that ive either proposed or cosponsored everything from the elimination of procedures like solitary confinement which many people consider torture all the way to helping people to reintegrate so we dont have such a stunningly high recidivism rate nationally as we do\\n\\nsen cory booker well look theres a lot of great energy thats building in washington as you know there is on the house side a piece of legislation thats already been introduced that has a lot of good elements to it and there is a lot of work here in the senateconversations im involved inabout trying to get a piece of solid legislation sometime in the coming months so im hopeful obviously its not moving as fast as i would like and a lot of the efforts are great steps but not as comprehensive as i would like but i just feel grateful that theres a bipartisan coalition trying to get something done in this congress\\n\\nleon neyfakh weve been hearing for many months now that were going to see criminal justice reform soon from where youre sitting do you have a sense of when it might actually happen\\n\\none exception is new jersey sen cory booker whom i spoke to by phone on friday during our conversation booker expressed unequivocal support for a position that has not yet become popular with his colleagues in washington if the united states is serious about ending mass incarceration it will require more than just lenience for drug offenders and other lowlevel criminals\\n\\nthere are two big reasons for this the first is that the proposed legislation would only apply to the federal prison system which houses just 10 percent of the nations inmates the second is that of the more than 15 million people in state prisons about half are there because theyve been convicted of violent offenses like murder rape and armed robbery most politicians dont have the stomach to talk about reducing sentences for violent offenders\\n\\nthe emerging consensus has created the impression that reform is around the cornerand it might very well be but none of the proposed legislation thats currently on the table can be expected to shrink the prison population by all that much \\n\\nbeing in favor of criminal justice reform these days is fashionable in washington politicians from the left and the right seem to agree that with 22 million people either in federal prison state prison or jail the united states is keeping a shameful percentage of its population behind bars\\n\\nat the big bipartisan criminal justice summit in dc a couple of months back you said something like we need to redefine what it means to commit a violent crime can you elaborate on that some people might think the line between violent and nonviolent would be straightforward why isnt it\\n\\nits just not i mean weve lumped a lot of things into the violent category accomplices to crimes robberies that often dont involve physical violence but i think we need to look at the totality of the things that were labeling as violent and really examine whether we need to have some more proportionality in terms of the punishment fitting the crime thats done the bright line that we have right now between violent and nonviolent does not account for shades of gray\\n\\ndo you make this argument when you talk to other legislators\\n\\nits definitely been part of my conversations but frankly as of now its not going that far\\n\\nwhat kind of reaction do you get\\n\\nlets just say the appetite is not there at this point for expanding that there are still battles being fought over basic criminal justice reform for socalled nonviolent offenders\\n\\ndo you see it as a question of incremental progress where reform for nonviolent offenders will open up the political space for bigger broader measures later\\n\\nthats my hope i hope that as we start putting points on the board for fiscal responsibility when it comes to criminal justice and for justice for proportionality for fairness we can expand after that to this gray area where we have people labeled as violent offenders but werent directly involved in acts of significant violence so my hope is that once we get some momentum well be able to address a much larger pool of people\\n\\none concern ive heard from activists and academics is that theres a conventional wisdom forming that the reason our prison population is so huge is because of nonviolent offenders even president obama during his big criminal justice speech in july said over the last few decades weve also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before for longer than ever before and that is the real reason our prison population is so high when i heard that i just thought thats not true\\n\\nwell look the drug war certainly has driven an explosion in incarceration and drug crimes do make up a very large percentage of what we have but again weve been doling out harsher and harsher penalties for all crimes\\n\\nive seen research that says only 17 percent of the inmates in state prisons are there for drug charges just 17 percent whereas 50 percent or so are there for crimes that are classified as violent does that mean talking about the problem in the way congress has been talking about it puts a pretty low ceiling on how much of a reduction in the prison population we can achieve\\n\\nright but theres some other data that we should talk about michelle alexander author of the new jim crow talks about how much marijuana arrests have fueled the explosion in arrests in our country her point is that we end up sending so many young people particularly young africanamericans and latinos into the system and what happens once you get a felony conviction now you are entering this american caste system where you cant get a job you cant get a loan you cant get a pell grant you cant get public housing and then those people often feel that they have no other options so they go back and commit crime again and again and again and what we saw in newark through a rutgers study was that about 84 percent of our murder victims had been arrested before an average of 10 times\\n\\nvictims\\n\\nvictims so what im saying is that because of these lowlevel drug crimes people get stuck in this world that eventually turns violent so im very concerned about how were treating the drug war and while i definitely want to deal with a more expansive view of who should be eligible for a lot of this legislation please understand that the drug war has really fueled so much of our problem the drug war has been a war where the direct casualties have primarily been americas poor americas minorities and often unfortunately americas vulnerable in terms of people with disease and addiction and mental health\\n\\nthere is some debate around the michelle alexander bookthere are people who say she overstates the role of the drug war in the mass incarceration boom and there is data that says the percentage of drug offenders in the prison population peaked in like 1990 at 22 percent so even when it was at the highest it has ever been 4 out of 5 people in prison were there for offenses that didnt involve drugs thats something i hear from folks who are worried that the focus is too much on drug crimes right now\\n\\ni guess im not into the tyranny of the or either this or that this system is broken along many many dimensions and to ignore the crisis of americas drug policies and the devastating impact its having in america is a very significant problem thats not to say theres not a problem with high mandatory minimums as a wholewhich have shifted our whole criminal justice system from courts and judges to prosecutorial discretion but the situation is bad all over\\n\\nas you said earlier its politically quite difficult to get lawmakers to look at the entire situation which would mean looking at people who are in prison for doing objectively bad things thats a high barrier for a lot of people because intuitively theres a pretty powerful argument to be made that the central purpose of prison is to keep violent offenders out of society but when you look at the data it seems like its an argument that will have to be prevailed upon if were ever going to see a really serious drop in the incarceration numbers\\n\\ni agree i agree theres a profound glaring injustice thats a significant part of our society that needs to be addressed\", \"Text_NoPunctuation\": \"I think what this movement is doing is trying to do things people think are more politically feasible Well the reality is that we really need to start expanding our view of

that have been such a major source of our mass incarceration problem need to be addressed There are other aspects of reform that are just as criticalmany of which are bills that Ive either proposed or cosponsored everything from the elimination of procedures like solitary confinement which many people consider torture all the way to helping people to reintegrate so we dont have such a stunningly high recidivism rate nationally as we do\\n\\nSen Cory Booker Well look theres a lot of great energy thats building in Washington as you know There is on the House side a piece of legislation thats already been introduced that has a lot of good elements to it and there is a lot of work here in the Senateconversations Im involved inabout trying to get a piece of solid legislation sometime in the coming months So Im hopeful Obviously its not moving as fast as I would like And a lot of the efforts are great steps but not as comprehensive as I would like But I just feel grateful that theres a bipartisan coalition trying to get something done in this Congress\\n\\nLeon Neyfakh Weve been hearing for many months now that were going to see criminal justice reform soon From where youre sitting do you have a sense of when it might actually happen\\n\\nOne exception is New Jersey Sen Cory Booker whom I spoke to by phone on Friday During our conversation Booker expressed unequivocal support for a position that has not yet become popular with his colleagues in Washington If the United States is serious about ending mass incarceration it will require more than just lenience for drug offenders and other lowlevel criminals\\n\\nThere are two big reasons for this The first is that the proposed legislation would only apply to the federal prison system which houses just 10 percent of the nations inmates The second is that of the more than 15 million people in state prisons about half are there because theyve been convicted of violent offenses like murder rape and armed robbery Most politicians dont have the stomach to talk about reducing sentences for violent offenders\\n\\nThe emerging consensus has created the impression that reform is around the cornerand it might very well be But none of the proposed legislation thats currently on the table can be expected to shrink the prison population by all that much \\n\\nBeing in favor of criminal justice reform these days is fashionable in Washington Politicians from the left and the right seem to agree that with 22 million people either in federal prison state prison or jail the United States is keeping a shameful percentage of its population behind bars\\n\\nAt the big Bipartisan Criminal Justice Summit in DC a couple of months back you said something like We need to redefine what it means to commit a violent crime Can you elaborate on that Some people might think the line between violent and nonviolent would be straightforward Why isnt it\\n\\nIts just not I mean weve lumped a lot of things into the violent category accomplices to crimes robberies that often dont involve physical violence But I think we need to look at the totality of the things that were labeling as violent and really examine whether we need to have some more proportionality in terms of the punishment fitting the crime thats done The bright line that we have right now between violent and nonviolent does not account for shades of gray\\n\\nDo you make this argument when you talk to other legislators\\n\\nIts definitely been part of my conversations But frankly as of now its not going that far\\n\\nWhat kind of reaction do you get\\n\\nLets just say the appetite is not there at this point for expanding that There are still battles being fought over basic criminal justice reform for socalled nonviolent offenders\\n\\nDo you see it as a question of incremental progress where reform for nonviolent offenders will open up the political space for bigger broader measures later\\n\\nThats my hope I hope that as we start putting points on the board for fiscal responsibility when it comes to criminal justice and for justice for proportionality for fairness we can expand after that to this gray area where we have people labeled as violent offenders but werent directly involved in acts of significant violence So my hope is that once we get some momentum well be able to address a much larger pool of people\\n\\nOne concern Ive heard from activists and academics is that theres a conventional wisdom forming that the reason our prison population is so huge is because of nonviolent offenders Even President Obama during his big criminal justice speech in July said Over the last few decades weve also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before for longer than ever before and that is the real reason our prison population is so high When I heard that I just thought Thats not true\\n\\nWell look the drug war certainly has driven an explosion in incarceration and drug crimes do make up a very large percentage of what we have But again weve been doling out harsher and harsher penalties for all crimes\\n\\nIve seen research that says only 17 percent of the inmates in state prisons are there for drug charges Just 17 percent Whereas 50 percent or so are there for crimes that are classified as violent Does that mean talking about the problem in the way Congress has been talking about it puts a pretty low ceiling on how much of a reduction in the prison population we can achieve\\n\\nRight but theres some other data that we should talk about Michelle Alexander author of The New Jim Crow talks about how much marijuana arrests have fueled the explosion in arrests in our country Her point is that we end up sending so many young people particularly young AfricanAmericans and Latinos into the system And what happens once you get a felony conviction Now you are entering this American caste system where you cant get a job you cant get a loan you cant get a Pell grant you cant get public housing And then those people often feel that they have no other options so they go back and commit crime again And again and again And what we saw in Newark through a Rutgers study was that about 84 percent of our murder victims had been arrested before an average of 10 times\\n\\nVictims\\n\\nVictims So what Im saying is that because of these lowlevel drug crimes people get stuck in this world that eventually turns violent So Im very concerned about how were treating the drug war And while I definitely want to deal with a more expansive view of who should be eligible for a lot of this legislation please understand that the drug war has really fueled so much of our problem The drug war has been a war where the direct casualties have primarily been Americas poor Americas minorities and often unfortunately Americas vulnerable in terms of people with disease and addiction and mental health\\n\\nThere is some debate around the Michelle Alexander bookthere are people who say she overstates the role of the drug war in the mass incarceration boom And there is data that says the percentage of drug offenders in the prison population peaked in like 1990 at 22 percent So even when it was at the highest it has ever been 4 out of 5 people in prison were there for offenses that didnt involve drugs Thats something I hear from folks who are worried that the focus is too much on drug crimes right now\\n\\nI guess Im not into the tyranny of the or either this or that This system is broken along many many dimensions And to ignore the crisis of Americas drug policies and the devastating impact its having in America is a very significant problem Thats not to say theres not a problem with high mandatory minimums as a wholewhich have shifted our whole criminal justice system from courts and judges to prosecutorial discretion But the situation is bad all over\\n\\nAs you said earlier its politically quite difficult to get lawmakers to look at the entire situation which would mean looking at people who are in prison for doing objectively bad things Thats a high barrier for a lot of people because intuitively theres a pretty powerful argument to be made that the central purpose of prison is to keep violent offenders out of society But when you look at the data it seems like its an argument that will have to be prevailed upon if were ever going to see a really serious drop in the incarceration numbers\\n\\nI agree I agree Theres a profound glaring injustice thats a significant part of our society that needs to be addressed\",

consensus created impression reform around cornerand might well none proposed legislation thats currently table expected shrink prison population much favor criminal justice reform days fashionable washington politicians left right seem agree 22 million people either federal prison state prison jail united states keeping shameful percentage population behind bars big bipartisan criminal justice summit dc couple months back said something like need redefine means commit violent crime elaborate people might think line violent nonviolent would straightforward isnt mean weve lumped lot things violent category accomplices crimes robberies often dont involve physical violence think need look totality things labeling violent really examine whether need proportionality terms punishment fitting crime thats done bright line right violent nonviolent account shades gray make argument talk legislators definitely part conversations frankly going far kind reaction get lets say appetite point expanding still battles fought basic criminal justice reform socalled nonviolent offenders see question incremental progress reform nonviolent offenders open political space bigger broader measures later thats hope hope start putting points board fiscal responsibility comes criminal justice justice proportionality fairness expand gray area people labeled violent offenders werent directly involved acts significant violence hope get momentum well able address much larger pool people one concern ive heard activists academics theres conventional wisdom forming reason prison population huge nonviolent offenders even president obama big criminal justice speech july said last decades weve also locked nonviolent drug offenders ever longer ever real reason prison population high heard thought thats true well look drug war certainly driven explosion incarceration drug crimes make large percentage weve doling harsher harsher penalties crimes ive seen research says 17 percent inmates state prisons drug charges 17 percent whereas 50 percent crimes classified violent mean talking problem way congress talking puts pretty low ceiling much reduction prison population achieve right theres data talk michelle alexander author new jim crow talks much marijuana arrests fueled explosion arrests country point end sending many young people particularly young africanamericans latinos system happens get felony conviction entering american caste system cant get job cant get loan cant get pell grant cant get public housing people often feel options go back commit crime saw newark rutgers study 84 percent murder victims arrested average 10 times victims victims im saying lowlevel drug crimes people get stuck world eventually turns violent im concerned treating drug war definitely want deal expansive view eligible lot legislation please understand drug war really fueled much problem drug war war direct casualties primarily americas poor americas minorities often unfortunately americas vulnerable terms people disease addiction mental health debate around michelle alexander bookthere people say overstates role drug war mass incarceration boom data says percentage drug offenders prison population peaked like 1990 22 percent even highest ever 4 5 people prison offenses didnt involve drugs thats something hear folks worried focus much drug crimes right guess im tyranny either system broken along many many dimensions ignore crisis americas drug policies devastating impact america significant problem thats say theres problem high mandatory minimums wholewhich shifted whole criminal justice system courts judges prosecutorial discretion situation bad said earlier politically quite difficult get lawmakers look entire situation would mean looking people prison objectively bad things thats high barrier lot people intuitively theres pretty powerful argument made central purpose prison keep violent offenders society look data seems like argument
