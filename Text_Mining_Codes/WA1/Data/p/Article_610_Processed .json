"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Elaine Thompson/AP Photo\\n\\nLets look at the Bernie Sanders plan for a fairer economy. Crafted in his years as the socialist Independent senator from Vermont, the proposal is at the center of his surprisingly robust campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\\n\\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.\\n\\nIf elected president (with a Democratic Congress), Sanders would end tuition for public colleges and universities, raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, invest in new infrastructureproviding jobs and skills throughout the countryexpand Social Security benefits, and make Medicare a national single-payer health insurance system. Add an ambitious plan for climate changecentered on a carbon taxand new Wall Street regulations meant to stop another financial crisis, and you have a wide agenda for redistribution that rivals Roosevelts New Deal, Trumans G.I. Bill, and Johnsons Great Society.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can read this as a left-liberal wishlist, but for Sanders and his supporters, its much more than that. To them, it is a serious plan to strike a powerful blow to inequality, from the wide gap between rich and poor, to the yawning divide between black and white. To be honest with you, explained Sanders in a June interview on ABCs This Week With George Stephanopoulos, given the disparity that were seeing in income and wealth in this country, it applies even more to the African-American community and to the Hispanic community.\\n\\nPartisans for the senator are even more forceful. Closing the racial wealth gap is probably the single most effective thing that any politician could do to help advance the cause of ending structural racism in America, writes Hamilton Nolan for Gawker, in praise and defense of Sanders. This is because promoting progressive economic policies that work against the extreme concentration of wealth in small groups of people is something that politicians can actually do that has actual real world effects on racial inequality.\\n\\nOf course, none of this would address racism, full stop. (And despite his clumsiness with racial conversations, neither Sanders nor his campaign has ever claimed it would.) It wouldnt end bias in hiring or other forms of employment discrimination, nor would it address concentrated poverty, residential segregation, housing affordability, or the broad problem of police violence. But in a world where the Sanders plan was law, racial minoritiesand blacks in particularwould have more and greater opportunity. Couple this with his outline for reducing race discrimination in criminal justicecrafted as a direct result of protests from Black Lives Matter activistsand Sanders has built an ambitious plan for tackling racial inequality across American society.\\n\\nBut, for the senators supporters and other observers, all of this just raises a question: If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race, then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform?\\n\\nLast week, for instance, protesters associated with Black Lives Matter interrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle. As with the first interruption, in July, this sparked days of intra-left debate and disagreement. Heres Nolan, again: For those perceptive enough to separate pretty slogans from actual policy prescriptions, it is clear that Bernie Sanders is the candidate most aligned with the groups values, he wrote, critiquing the demonstrators. Stifling his voice only helps his opponents.\\n\\nOn the other side are writers like New Republic editor Jamil Smith, who are much more sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter activists. Im not against criticizing activist tactics, he wrote, but the idea that Black Lives Matter protesters are hurting their cause by challenging candidates, even those considered allies, is based in the notion that the burden of making change is on them. It isnt.\\n\\nPart of the problem in this debateand why its so frustrating to its participantsis that no one has tried to answer the why question. Instead, the argument is over tactics, excess, and the prerogatives and responsibilities that come with protesting. Should Black Lives Matter go easy on Sanders? Is the message more important than the particular tactic?\\n\\nSet those questions aside, however, and you have an easy answer for why Sanders gets the brunt of Black Lives Matter activity, at least among Democratic presidential candidates. Unlike his competitors, Sanders is simply the best available vessel for bringing activists concerns to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nThe picture might be different if Sanders were more marginal and on the periphery of the nomination fight (like former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb). As it stands, the Vermont senator is the leading alternative to frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. He earns almost 20 percent or more in most national polls of the race, and is effectively tied for first in New Hampshire. He also dwarfs any other candidate for presidentin either partyin terms of shear crowd size: 27,000 in Los Angeles, 28,000 in Portland, Oregon, and 15,000 in Seattle, where his speech was interrupted last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, Sanders doesnt have the tightly closed-down campaign of Hillary Clinton. He is accessible, as evidenced by the ease with which activists have reached him on stage. And while hes been clumsy in these incidents, he also hasnt lashed out. In both cases, he ceded the mic. Compare that to the attempted Black Lives Matter protest at a Clinton rally in New Hampshire. Activists reached the event, but they couldnt get past security to announce their presence.\\n\\nIn this environment, if youre trying to make a splash, you go with Sanders, especially when hes more open to change and adjustment than the alternatives. Disrupting Sanders gives you more bang for your buck: It keeps you in the news and puts indirect pressure on other campaigns that know theyll have to answer to the movements questions. To that point, the New Hampshire demonstrators couldnt crash the Clinton rally, but they still met with the candidatequietlyand discussed their concerns. In all likelihood, the pressure on Sanders has forced Clintonthe likely nomineeto devote more time to Black Lives Matter, in a bid to protect her flank. And in turn, this brings their issues up the ladder, closer to the top of the partys agenda.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"elaine\"], [\"elaine\", \"thompsonap\"], [\"thompsonap\", \"photo\"],

changecentered on a carbon taxand new wall street regulations meant to stop another financial crisis and you have a wide agenda for redistribution that rivals roosevelts new deal trumans gi bill and johnsons great society\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nyou can read this as a leftliberal wishlist but for sanders and his supporters its much more than that to them it is a serious plan to strike a powerful blow to inequality from the wide gap between rich and poor to the yawning divide between black and white to be honest with you explained sanders in a june interview on abcs this week with george stephanopoulos given the disparity that were seeing in income and wealth in this country it applies even more to the africanamerican community and to the hispanic community\\n\\npartisans for the senator are even more forceful closing the racial wealth gap is probably the single most effective thing that any politician could do to help advance the cause of ending structural racism in america writes hamilton nolan for gawker in praise and defense of sanders this is because promoting progressive economic policies that work against the extreme concentration of wealth in small groups of people is something that politicians can actually do that has actual real world effects on racial inequality\\n\\nof course none of this would address racism full stop and despite his clumsiness with racial conversations neither sanders nor his campaign has ever claimed it would it wouldnt end bias in hiring or other forms of employment discrimination nor would it address concentrated poverty residential segregation housing affordability or the broad problem of police violence but in a world where the sanders plan was law racial minoritiesand blacks in particularwould have more and greater opportunity couple this with his outline for reducing race discrimination in criminal justicecrafted as a direct result of protests from black lives matter activistsand sanders has built an ambitious plan for tackling racial inequality across american society\\n\\nbut for the senators supporters and other observers all of this just raises a question if sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race then why is he a target for black lives matter activists even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform\\n\\nlast week for instance protesters associated with black lives matter interrupted a sanders rally in seattle as with the first interruption in july this sparked days of intraleft debate and disagreement heres nolan again for those perceptive enough to separate pretty slogans from actual policy prescriptions it is clear that bernie sanders is the candidate most aligned with the groups values he wrote critiquing the demonstrators stifling his voice only helps his opponents\\n\\non the other side are writers like new republic editor jamil smith who are much more sympathetic to the black lives matter activists im not against criticizing activist tactics he wrote but the idea that black lives matter protesters are hurting their cause by challenging candidates even those considered allies is based in the notion that the burden of making change is on them it isnt\\n\\npart of the problem in this debateand why its so frustrating to its participantsis that no one has tried to answer the why question instead the argument is over tactics excess and the prerogatives and responsibilities that come with protesting should black lives matter go easy on sanders is the message more important than the particular

the Bernie Sanders plan for a fairer economy Crafted in his years as the socialist Independent senator from Vermont the proposal is at the center of his surprisingly robust campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination\\n\\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slates chief political correspondent\\n\\nIf elected president with a Democratic Congress Sanders would end tuition for public colleges and universities raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour invest in new infrastructureproviding jobs and skills throughout the countryexpand Social Security benefits and make Medicare a national singlepayer health insurance system Add an ambitious plan for climate changecentered on a carbon taxand new Wall Street regulations meant to stop another financial crisis and you have a wide agenda for redistribution that rivals Roosevelts New Deal Trumans GI Bill and Johnsons Great Society\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can read this as a leftliberal wishlist but for Sanders and his supporters its much more than that To them it is a serious plan to strike a powerful blow to inequality from the wide gap between rich and poor to the yawning divide between black and white To be honest with you explained Sanders in a June interview on ABCs This Week With George Stephanopoulos given the disparity that were seeing in income and wealth in this country it applies even more to the AfricanAmerican community and to the Hispanic community\\n\\nPartisans for the senator are even more forceful Closing the racial wealth gap is probably the single most effective thing that any politician could do to help advance the cause of ending structural racism in America writes Hamilton Nolan for Gawker in praise and defense of Sanders This is because promoting progressive economic policies that work against the extreme concentration of wealth in small groups of people is something that politicians can actually do that has actual real world effects on racial inequality\\n\\nOf course none of this would address racism full stop And despite his clumsiness with racial conversations neither Sanders nor his campaign has ever claimed it would It wouldnt end bias in hiring or other forms of employment discrimination nor would it address concentrated poverty residential segregation housing affordability or the broad problem of police violence But in a world where the Sanders plan was law racial minoritiesand blacks in particularwould have more and greater opportunity Couple this with his outline for reducing race discrimination in criminal justicecrafted as a direct result of protests from Black Lives Matter activistsand Sanders has built an ambitious plan for tackling racial inequality across American society\\n\\nBut for the senators supporters and other observers all of this just raises a question If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform\\n\\nLast week for instance protesters associated with Black Lives Matter interrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle As with the first interruption in July this sparked days of intraleft debate and disagreement Heres Nolan again For those perceptive enough to separate pretty slogans from actual policy prescriptions it is clear that Bernie Sanders is the candidate most aligned with the groups values he wrote critiquing the demonstrators Stifling his voice only helps his opponents\\n\\nOn the other side are writers like New Republic editor Jamil Smith who are much more sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter activists Im not against criticizing activist tactics he wrote but the idea that Black Lives Matter protesters are hurting their cause by challenging candidates even those considered allies is based in the notion that the burden of making change is on them It isnt\\n\\nPart of the problem in this debateand why its so frustrating to its participantsis that no one has tried to answer the why question Instead the argument is over tactics excess and the prerogatives and responsibilities that come with protesting Should Black Lives Matter go easy on Sanders Is the message more important than the particular tactic\\n\\nSet those questions aside however and you have an easy answer for why Sanders gets the brunt of Black Lives Matter activity at least among Democratic presidential candidates Unlike his competitors Sanders is simply the best available vessel for bringing activists concerns to the mainstream of the Democratic Party\\n\\nThe picture might be different if Sanders were more marginal and on the periphery of the nomination fight like former Virginia Sen Jim Webb As it stands the Vermont senator is the leading
