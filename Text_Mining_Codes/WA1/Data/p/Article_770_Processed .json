"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Crash Course Astronomy/Thought Cafe\\n\\nFor the two dozenth episode of Crash Course Astronomy, we have to take a step away from the straight astronomy stuff and talk a little bit about light. After all, pretty much everything we know about the Universe is information sent via electromagnetic radiation, and as we press on into the cosmos well need to know something about how it works.\\n\\nSo let me illuminate you:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nYou probably dont think much about light, but holy wow does it store a lot of information into teeny little photons. This is a part of astronomy, of science, that reaches into my brain and tickles my mind; we see objects so far away that just the numbers describing their distance seem huge beyond imagining, yet that trickle of light tells us what those objects are, how far they are, what theyre made of, how hot they are, how rapidly theyre moving, whether and how fast theyre rotating, how strong any magnetic field they might have is, even giving us hints of the existence of things we cant see. And even then, theres still so much more.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"crash\"], [\"crash\", \"course\"], [\"course\", \"astronomythought\"], [\"astronomythought\", \"cafe\"], [\"cafe\",
