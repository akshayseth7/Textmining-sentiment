"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images\\n\\nDear McDonalds,\\n\\nIts been a lovely run. Every 30 or so days, youve shared your monthly same-store sales figures, and every 30 days or so, weve dutifully compiled the numbers into charts to follow their rise and fall (mostly fall). We watched in December as comps in the United States peaked into positive territory for the first time in 13 months and even stayed there through January, before toppling 4 percent in February. We stood by in June as global comps dropped 0.3 percent to mark a year of consecutive declines.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in late May you told us that these rendezvous would have to end. So here we are, on the day of your second-quarter earnings report, to observe the last installment of the Monthly Misery Watch. Once again, you disappointed. U.S. comps down 1.7 percent in June. Global comps off 1.3 percent. Heres one last chart, for old times sake:\\n\\nData from McDonalds. Chart by Alison Griswold.\\n\\n\\n\\nSure, we know that this is whats right for you. Your CEO, Steve Easterbrook, will get some breathing room to focus on long-term improvement instead of monthly flirtations with investors. Now that youve ceased an out-of-date financial reporting practice (one that Walmart gave up six years ago), maybe youll succeed in becoming a modern, progressive burger company. Maybe youll finally get all-day breakfast off the ground in the U.S. nationwide (as the Wall Street Journal reported could happen by October), delighting diners with near-constant access to the Egg McMuffin. Maybe youll even stop trying stunts like Pay With Lovin .\\n\\nStill, whats best for you is tough for us. When August rolls around, well wonder how your same-store sales fared in July, and in September how they did in August. And weve finally accepted this is really happening. When we were still in denial in late May, we consulted a top accounting firm, which assured us that companies arent required to provide their same-store sales on a monthly basis. Yes, well still get some comps information in the quarterly reports, but lets be honestthats just a third as fun.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat were trying to say is, we understand why your same-store sales are leaving us, but were still sad to see them go. We hope youll change your mind, but recognize that you probably wont. Well look forward to seeing what you include next earnings cycle, in three months. Until then, its been real.\\n\\nLove,\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"chris\"], [\"chris\", \"mcgrathgetty\"], [\"mcgrathgetty\", \"image\"], [\"image\", \"dear\"], [\"dear\", \"mcdonalds\"],
