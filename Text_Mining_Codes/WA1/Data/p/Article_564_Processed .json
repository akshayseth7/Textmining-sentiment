"{\"Text\": \"Still from the video for Cant Feel My Face.\\n\\nA singer steps in front of a glittery curtain on a tiny stage at a seedy nightclub. As he begins to sing, he leans hard into the mic, closing his eyes and throwing down his best Michael Jackson splayed-leg dance moves. The crowd at the club looks on passivelya woman smiles coyly, but the rest look bored, unmoved, even hostile. One person flings a drink at him. Finally, a grizzled clubgoer flicks open his cigarette lighter and tosses the lit Zippo at the stage. Rather than duck out of the way, the singer executes a tight spin and is engulfed in flames. All at once, the crowd goes wild, rising to their feet and jamming hard to the song as the ablaze performer dances and sings even more frantically. As the club keeps dancing, the singer exits, utterly spent and still, literally, on fire.\\n\\nThis is the plot of the music video for Cant Feel My Face, the new No. 1 song in America. Its by Canadian singer, songwriter and producer Abel Tesfaye, who since 2010 has recorded as The Weeknd. Rarely has a music video so openly depicted a singers wary, all-consuming relationship with his own audience. (Even Kurt Cobain was more indirect.) As recently as 12 months ago, The Weeknd was largely known for a lush, quirky brand of alternative R&B, mostly issued on mixtapes, and for avoiding the media circus that is a mainstream pop career. But as Face takes over the No. 1 spot on Billboards Hot 100 chart this week, the tonsorially unique singer goes the last mile in his self-immolating quest to transform himselffrom critically acclaimed, blogger-obsessing fetish object, to mass-appeal heir to Michael Jacksons throne.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nIf youre going to sacrifice yourself at the altar of the marketplace, it might as well be with something as sumptuous as Cant Feel My Face, one of the most irresistible songs of the year. It is what music-biz and radio-programmer folk refer to as a one-listen record, a single whose trajectory is obvious from the first play. From the moment Face leaked in late May, pop-watchers were frothing about its potential, and it spent the summer fulfilling its chart inevitability. At the early-June launch event for the new Apple Music, The Weeknd was given a live showcase to officially debut the trackperhaps unsurprisingly, it wound up being the most-played song on Beats 1, Apples new global radio station. After debuting on the Hot 100 nearly halfway into the Top 40, it never saw a down weeknotable in an era where singles tend to debut high on sales to rabid fans, then cool before maybe catching on later with casual listeners and radio. Face hurtled into the Top 10 in just two weeks, broke into the top three by mid-July, and was lying in wait behind OMIs chart-topper Cheerleader by the start of August. After three weeks in the Hot 100s runner-up slot, it overtakes OMIs smash this week.\\n\\nWhile it may have broken too late in the season to wind up the official 2015 Song of Summer, Face sounds like it was made for hot weather. Its as combustible as its video. It hybridizes several Quincy Jonesera Jackson tropesthe spooky groove of Off the Wall, the uptempo force and power of Dont Stop til You Get Enoughwith a stomping post-hip-hop beat and a blissed-out haze reminiscent of the Steve Miller Bands Fly Like an Eagle. Indeed, the song is about the narcotic, numbing effect of a powerful sexual relationship, as embodied in its absurdist chorus: I cant feel my face when Im with you/But I love it.\\n\\nThis druggy theme is not far removed from Tesfayes prior work. Born in 1990 to Ethiopian parents whod emigrated to the Toronto suburb Scarborough, young Abel began recording murky R&B punctuated by his keening falsetto in his late teens. In 2010, he uploaded to YouTube a few tracks recorded for a project originally titled The Weekend (with correct spellingTesfaye dropped the third e after an acrimonious breakup with the Weekend projects founding producer). Those tracks made The Weeknd an immediate online sensation. In 2011 alone, Tesfaye dropped three indie mixtapesHouse of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silencebut declined all interviews, shrouding in mystery who, or what, The Weeknd even was. Starting with Balloons, critics keyed into The Weeknds narcotics-focused, and occasionally downright frightening lyrics; Echoes of Silence even led off with a skeletal cover of Michael Jacksons most sex-shaming hit, Dirty Diana.\\n\\nThese bleary-eyed tracks and morning-after themes caught a wave. In the wake of Kanye Wests seminal, commercially suicidal 808s and Heartbreak, a certain brand of downbeat rap and souleventually branded with the now widely regretted term PBR&Bsimultaneously recounted drug and sexual adventurism and expressed detached regret about such wickedness: the ultimate humblebrag. Even before Tesfaye signed to a major label, he caught the attention of his fellow Canadian Drake and made a cameo on the Toronto rappers 2011 album Take Care, a totem of its emo-hip-hop moment.\\n\\nWith Cant Feel My Face, The Weeknd has taken this dark, dazed loopiness and transformed it into pure pop. That transformation required an assist from several talented pros. Foremost among them is Max Martina name youve probably noticed in this No. 1 hits series quite a few times before. The Swedish uber-producer and songwriter behind all of Taylor Swifts chart-toppers, Martin now adds another one to his roster, bringing him closer to becoming the Hot 100s all-time top hitmaker (hes creeping up behind Beatles producer George Martin and songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney). Max Martin co-wrote Face with Tesfaye as well as several additional songsmiths, among them former Cardigans guitarist Peter Svensson; and he co-produced it with Iranian producerremixer Ali Payami (a guy who seems determined to work on all of my favorite songs this yearPayami also cowrote Swifts superlative Style). The Weeknd was hooked up with all of these hit specialists by Monte Lipman and Charlie Walk, the executives who lead dominant pop label Republic Records (part of the Universal empire). By Walks own admission, they began plotting The Weeknds pop conquest more than a year in advance.\\n\\nBeauty Behind the Madness, the album featuring these two songs, is set to appear later this month, and it will be the ultimate market test of Weekend v2.0. Its actually Tesfayes second major-label album (third, if you count a 2012 repackaging of his three 2011 mixtapes as Trilogy). The Weeknds 2013 major-label debut, Kiss Land, was essentially a bigger-budget version of the dark, forbidding mixtapes he had produced on his own; Republic gave Tesfaye the chance to get that sound fully out of his system. Kiss Land sold respectably but generated no hitsa result that the Abel of two years ago didnt seem to mind. Whereas every move Tesfaye has made over the last year has indicated he is ready to shed his alt-R&B-cred persona. I felt I had to change who I was, he told The New York Times Jon Caramanica last month.\\n\\nSuch cred policing is not limited to the world of white rock starship-hop has also seen its share of contentious change-ups. The history of the Black Eyed Peas can be divided into a before time, when they styled themselves as crunchy 90s backpacker-rappers, and a multiplatinum decade in which they partnered with pop singer Fergie and earned the scorn of hip-hop heads. (They are now attempting to reverse the process.) And when OutKast made the shift from deep-south weirdos to chart-topping megastars, Andre 3000 would throw shade at the duos new fans who werent followers from the beginning. But in general, black music over the last three decades has had a different, more pragmatic relationship with commercial achievement. As journalist and radio host Dan Charnas noted in his terrific 2010 rap history The Big Payback, the hip-hop community has always been more goal-oriented toward multiplatinum success, with black MCs and moguls profiting from the genre the way their white predecessors had co-opted and profited from rock and roll.\\n\\nIn a way, going full-Jacko was a smart end run around this entire crossover predicament for The Weeknd. Unlike Neil Young, Sinead OConnor or even OutKast, he doesnt seem to regard his pop success as a sideline or byway to some larger, less compromised project. Hes already four Top 10 hits into what looks, to any reasonable observer, like a full career shift.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"still\", \"video\"], [\"video\", \"cant\"], [\"cant\", \"feel\"],
