(He said that he hoped \\\"to be back on the field soon.\\\") Thursday, he sent a tweet that seemed to imply some progress on that front:\\n\\nFebruary 2014 was the month that Michael Sam came out publicly, after which his father Michael Sam Sr. told the New York Times that he (Sam Sr.) was \\\"a man-and-a-woman type of guy\\\" who said he wouldn't want his grandchildren \\\"raised in that kind of environment,\\\" i.e. a family with two gay parents.\\n\\nLast November, BuzzFeed's Joel Anderson wrote a piece about the elder Sam and the difficult relationship between the two. Michael Sam Sr. was divorced from his son's mother JoAnn before Sam Jr. was bornbut remarried her later and is now separated from her againand admits that he failed to adequately support the troubled family because he was \\\"running around and spending money and shooting dice.\\\" Wrote Anderson, whose piece was published soon after Sam Jr. had been cut from the Cowboys: \\\"Disappointment and loss are feelings Michael Sr. knows well, of course, so the two Michaels have more in common now than they may have ever had. And yet Michael Jr. doesnt come to his father  or anyone in his family  for comfort.
