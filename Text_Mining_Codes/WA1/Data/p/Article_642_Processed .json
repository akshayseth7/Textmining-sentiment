"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n\\nCriminal justice reform is a contentious political issue, but theres one point on which pretty much everyone agrees: Americas prison population is way too high. Its possible that a decline has already begun, with the number of state and federal inmates dropping for three years straight starting in 2010, from an all-time high of 1.62 million in 2009 to about 1.57 million in 2012. But change has been slow: Even if the downward trend continues, which is far from guaranteed, it could take almost 90 years for the countrys prison population to get down to where it was in 1980 unless the rate of decline speeds up significantly.\\n\\nLeon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer.\\n\\nWhat can be done to make the population drop faster? Many reformers, operating under the assumption that mass incarceration is first and foremost the result of the war on drugs, have focused on making drug laws less punitive and getting rid of draconian sentencing laws that require judges to impose impossibly harsh punishments on people who have committed relatively minor crimes. But according to John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School, neither of those efforts will make a significant dent in the problem, because they are based on a false understanding of why the prison boom happened in the first place.* Having analyzed statistics on who goes to prison, why, and for how long, Pfaff has emerged with a new and provocative account of how the problem of mass incarceration came to be. If hes right, the implications for the prison reform movement are huge and suggest the work needed to achieve real progress will be much harder than most people realize.\\n\\nIn a conversation with Slate, Pfaff explains his theory.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. prison population increased fivefold between 1980 and 2009from approximately 320,000 inmates to 1.62 million. When you look at the work of scholars and the policymakers who are influenced by them, what do you see as the dominant explanations for why this happened?\\n\\nOne is that were sending people to prison for more and more and more time. The other is the war on drugsthat weve made this concerted effort to target people for drug dealing and drug possession, and were filling up our prisons with all of these drug-related offenses. The dominant view is that those two changes have transformed the size of the prison population in the United States.\\n\\nWhat do you think of those two explanations?\\n\\nI understand where they come from. Its true that legislators have passed a lot of new, tougher sentencing laws over the past 30 or 40 years. And its true that we have increased the attention paid to drugs. But in the end, there are other things that play a much, much bigger role in explaining prison growth. The fact of the matter is in todays state prisons, which hold about 90 percent of all of our prisoners, only 17 percent of the inmates are there primarily for drug charges. And about two-thirds are there for either property or violent crimes.\\n\\nHas the percentage of drug offenders among the prison population been higher in the past?\\n\\nIt peaked in 1990 at 22 percent and then steadily declined. So even when the percentage of drug offenders among the state prison population was at its peak, about four out of every five people were there for a nondrug offense.\\n\\nWhy are you skeptical of the idea that longer sentences have been a significant driver of the prison boom?\\n\\nIf you released every person in prison on a drug charge today, our state prison population would drop from about 1.5 million to 1.2 million.\\n\\nBecause while its true that legislators have passed a lot of longer sentences, if you actually look at time served by inmates in prison, it doesnt appear to have changed that much. We have good data going back approximately 20 years or so, and at least in northern and northwestern states where we have better data, about half of all prisoners who get admitted in a given year only spend about two or three years in prison. And only about 10 percent serve more than about seven or eight years in prison. These laws look incredibly punitive25 years for a class B felonybut you just dont see people serving that amount of time.\\n\\nOK. So if its not the drug war, and its not harsh sentencing laws, what is it? What do you think caused the prison boom?\\n\\nYou need to break the question into two periods. Because theres a time between 1975 and 1991 when you see this dramatic rise in crime, and the prison population went up as well. And then theres a more interesting period, between 1991 and 2010, when crime steadily declined, yet prison populations kept going up. So, between 75 and 91, its almost certain that the increase in crime had to play at least some significant role in increasing the prison population. The scale of the crime boom that took place was dramatic: From 1960 to 1991, violent crime rose by 400 percent, and property crime rose by 200 percent. Figuring out how much of prison growth can be attributed to the crime boom is actually statistically quite difficult, but the best estimate thats out therewhich is not a perfect estimate, but its the best we havesuggests that about half of prison growth during that period was due to rising crime. Clearly other stuff mattered, but rising crime played a very big role during the first phase.\\n\\nSo why did the prison population keep on rising after 1991, when the crime wave ended? It seems like if your theory is right, that the increase in violent crime and property crime caused the prison boom, the end of the crime wave should have been accompanied by decreasing incarceration rates.\\n\\nThree things could have happened. One, police just got much more efficienttheyre just arresting more and more people, with new policing technologies, new policing approachesmaybe theyre just arresting a bigger share of offenders. But we dont actually see that. Arrests tend to drop with the crime rate. So the total number of people being arrested has fallen. The other thing it could be is were just locking people up for longerbut like I said, its not that. So clearly whats happening is were just admitting more people to prison. Though we have a smaller pool of people being arrested, were sending a larger and larger number of them to prison.\\n\\nWhy would that be?\\n\\nWhat appears to happen during this timethe years I look at are 1994 to 2008, just based on the data thats availableis that the probability that a district attorney files a felony charge against an arrestee goes from about 1 in 3, to 2 in 3. So over the course of the 90s and 2000s, district attorneys just got much more aggressive in how they filed charges. Defendants who they would not have filed felony charges against before, they now are charging with felonies. I cant tell you why theyre doing that. No ones really got an answer to that yet. But it does seem that the number of felony cases filed shoots up very strongly, even as the number of arrests goes down.\\n\\nIsnt the traditional explanation for why prosecutors tend to be overzealous is that their political careers depend on it?\\n\\nThe political question is interesting because generally the district attorney election is not very difficult to win. DAs tend to win elections pretty regularly. So, when Joe Hynes was defeated in the Democratic primary in Brooklyn, New York, in 2012, he was the first sitting Brooklyn DA to run for re-election and lose in more than a century. But thats not to say that politics dont matter: Maybe its that next election theyre looking at, that they remain tough on crime because they want to become attorney general or governor. Theres no clear data on this. Were only just starting to look at this question. But that strikes me as a possible story. What might have happened is the crime boom made being a prosecutor more of a launch-pad positionit elevated the status of prosecutors, and perhaps elevated their political ambitions, and they remained tough on crime even as crime started going down.\\n\\nOK. So why does any of this matter? Why is it important for reformers to have the right theory for why mass incarceration happened?\\n\\nThe reason its important to get it right is that if were trying to reduce the prison population, we want to make sure we do it correctlyand if you focus on the wrong thing, you wont solve the problem. So if you think its the war on drugs, you might think, OK, if we just decriminalize drugs, that will solve the problem. And, you know, its true that if we shift away from punishment to treatment that could be a huge improvement. But just letting people out of prisondecarcerating drug offenderswill not reduce the prison population by as much as people think. If you released every person in prison on a drug charge today, our state prison population would drop from about 1.5 million to 1.2 million. So wed still be the worlds largest incarcerating country; wed still have an enormous prison population.\\n\\nAnd if we focused on cutting back sentence lengths, maybe that would weaken DAs bargaining power at plea bargaining, but since people arent serving the massively long sentences anyway, it probably wont have that big an effect on prison population either.\\n\\nWhat would?\\n\\nWell, the real growth in the prison population comes from county-level district attorneys sending violent people to prison. And theres a lot to be said for nonprison approaches to a lot of people who are in prison for violent crimes. But thats a political issue that we havent even begun to address, in part because its politically scary.\\n\\nWhere does that leave reformers who want to see the prison population drop significantly?\\n\\nWhat makes it very hard is that the person we really need to target nowwhose behavior we need to regulateis the district attorney, and the district attorney is a very politically independent figure. Hes directly elected, and hes directly elected at the county level. So theres no big centralized fix. You cant necessarily go to Washington and say, Heres the law thats going to control what the DAs do, because they dont have to listen to the federal government at all. So you have to figure out how to go county by county and either elect DAs who have less punitive attitudes, or you can try to sort of change the incentives DAs face at the state level. But its very tricky.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"justin\"], [\"justin\", \"sullivangetty\"], [\"sullivangetty\", \"image\"], [\"image\",

theres one point on which pretty much everyone agrees americas prison population is way too high its possible that a decline has already begun with the number of state and federal inmates dropping for three years straight starting in 2010 from an alltime high of 162 million in 2009 to about 157 million in 2012 but change has been slow even if the downward trend continues which is far from guaranteed it could take almost 90 years for the countrys prison population to get down to where it was in 1980 unless the rate of decline speeds up significantly\\n\\nleon neyfakh leon neyfakh is a slate staff writer\\n\\nwhat can be done to make the population drop faster many reformers operating under the assumption that mass incarceration is first and foremost the result of the war on drugs have focused on making drug laws less punitive and getting rid of draconian sentencing laws that require judges to impose impossibly harsh punishments on people who have committed relatively minor crimes but according to john pfaff a professor at fordham law school neither of those efforts will make a significant dent in the problem because they are based on a false understanding of why the prison boom happened in the first place having analyzed statistics on who goes to prison why and for how long pfaff has emerged with a new and provocative account of how the problem of mass incarceration came to be if hes right the implications for the prison reform movement are huge and suggest the work needed to achieve real progress will be much harder than most people realize\\n\\nin a conversation with slate pfaff explains his theory\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nthe us prison population increased fivefold between 1980 and 2009from approximately 320000 inmates to 162 million when you look at the work of scholars and the policymakers who are influenced by them what do you see as the dominant explanations for why this happened\\n\\none is that were sending people to prison for more and more and more time the other is the war on drugsthat weve made this concerted effort to target people for drug dealing and drug possession and were filling up our prisons with all of these drugrelated offenses the dominant view is that those two changes have transformed the size of the prison population in the united states\\n\\nwhat do you think of those two explanations\\n\\ni understand where they come from its true that legislators have passed a lot of new tougher sentencing laws over the past 30 or 40 years and its true that we have increased the attention paid to drugs but in the end there are other things that play a much much bigger role in explaining prison growth the fact of the matter is in todays state prisons which hold about 90 percent of all of our prisoners only 17 percent of the inmates are there primarily for drug charges and about twothirds are there for either property or violent crimes\\n\\nhas the percentage of drug offenders among the prison population been higher in the past\\n\\nit peaked in 1990 at 22 percent and then steadily declined so even when the percentage of drug offenders among the state prison population was at its peak about four out of every five people were there for a nondrug offense\\n\\nwhy are you skeptical of the idea that longer sentences have been a significant driver of the prison boom\\n\\nif you released every person in prison on a drug charge today our state prison population would drop from about 15 million to 12 million\\n\\nbecause while its true that legislators have passed a lot of longer sentences if you actually look at time served by inmates in prison it doesnt appear to have changed that much we have good data going back approximately 20 years or so and at least in northern and northwestern states where we have better data about half of all prisoners who get admitted in a given year only spend about two or three years in prison and only about 10 percent serve more than about seven or eight years in prison these laws look incredibly punitive25 years for a class b felonybut you just dont see people serving that amount of time\\n\\nok so if its not the drug war and its not harsh sentencing laws what is it what do you think caused the prison boom\\n\\nyou need to break the question into two periods because theres a time between 1975 and 1991 when you see this dramatic rise in crime and the prison population went up as well and then theres a more interesting period between 1991 and 2010 when crime steadily declined yet prison populations kept going up so between 75 and 91 its almost certain that the increase in crime had to play at least some significant role in increasing the prison population the scale of the crime boom that took place was dramatic from 1960 to 1991 violent crime rose by 400 percent and property crime rose by 200 percent figuring out how much of prison growth can be attributed to the crime boom is actually statistically quite difficult but the best estimate thats out therewhich is not a perfect estimate but its the best we havesuggests that about half of prison growth during that period was due to rising crime clearly other stuff mattered but rising crime played a very big role during the first phase\\n\\nso why did the prison population keep on rising after 1991 when the crime wave ended it seems like if your theory is right that the increase in violent crime and property crime caused the prison boom the end of the crime wave should have been accompanied by decreasing incarceration rates\\n\\nthree things could have happened one police just got much more efficienttheyre just arresting more and more people with new policing technologies new policing approachesmaybe theyre just arresting a bigger share of offenders but we dont actually see that arrests tend to drop with the crime rate so the total number of people being arrested has fallen the other thing it could be is were just locking people up for longerbut like i said its not that so clearly whats happening is were just admitting more people to prison though we have a smaller pool of people being arrested were sending a larger and larger number of them to prison\\n\\nwhy would that be\\n\\nwhat appears to happen during this timethe years i look at are 1994 to 2008 just based on the data thats availableis that the probability that a district attorney files a felony charge against an arrestee goes from about 1 in 3 to 2 in 3 so over the course of the 90s and 2000s district attorneys just got much more aggressive in how they filed charges defendants who they would not have filed felony charges against before they now are charging with felonies i cant tell you why theyre doing that no ones really got an answer to that yet but it does seem that the number of felony cases filed shoots up very strongly even as the number of arrests goes down\\n\\nisnt the traditional explanation for why prosecutors tend to be overzealous is that their political careers depend on it\\n\\nthe political question is interesting because generally the district attorney election is not very difficult to win das tend to win elections pretty regularly so when joe hynes was defeated in the democratic primary in brooklyn new york in 2012 he was the first sitting brooklyn da to run for reelection and lose in more than a century but thats not to say that politics dont matter maybe its that next election theyre looking at that they remain tough on crime because they want to become attorney general or governor theres no clear data on this were only just starting to look at this question but that strikes me as a possible story what might have happened is the crime boom made being a prosecutor more of a launchpad positionit elevated the status of prosecutors and perhaps elevated their political ambitions and they remained tough on crime even as crime started going down\\n\\nok so why does any of this matter why is it important for reformers to have the right theory for why mass incarceration happened\\n\\nthe reason its important to get it right is that if were trying to reduce the prison population we want to make sure we do it correctlyand if you focus on the wrong thing you wont solve the problem so if you think its the war on drugs you might think ok if we just decriminalize drugs that will solve the problem and you know its true that if we shift away from punishment to treatment that could be a huge improvement but just letting people out of prisondecarcerating drug offenderswill not reduce the prison population by as much as people think if you released every person in prison on a drug charge today our state prison population would drop from about 15 million to 12 million so wed still be the worlds largest incarcerating country wed still have an enormous prison population\\n\\nand if we focused on cutting back sentence lengths maybe that would weaken das bargaining power at plea bargaining but since people arent serving the massively long sentences anyway it probably wont have that big an effect on prison population either\\n\\nwhat would\\n\\nwell the real growth in the prison population comes from countylevel district attorneys sending violent people to prison and theres a lot to be said for nonprison approaches to a lot of people who are in prison for violent crimes but thats a political issue that we havent even begun to address in part because its politically scary\\n\\nwhere does that leave reformers who want to see the prison population drop significantly\\n\\nwhat makes it very hard is that the person we really need to target nowwhose behavior we need to regulateis the district attorney and the district attorney is a very politically independent figure hes directly elected and hes directly elected at the county level so theres no big centralized fix you cant necessarily go to washington and say heres the law thats going to control what the das do because they dont have to listen to the federal government at all so you have to figure out how to go county by county and either elect das who have less punitive attitudes or you can try to sort of change the incentives

problem of mass incarceration came to be If hes right the implications for the prison reform movement are huge and suggest the work needed to achieve real progress will be much harder than most people realize\\n\\nIn a conversation with Slate Pfaff explains his theory\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US prison population increased fivefold between 1980 and 2009from approximately 320000 inmates to 162 million When you look at the work of scholars and the policymakers who are influenced by them what do you see as the dominant explanations for why this happened\\n\\nOne is that were sending people to prison for more and more and more time The other is the war on drugsthat weve made this concerted effort to target people for drug dealing and drug possession and were filling up our prisons with all of these drugrelated offenses The dominant view is that those two changes have transformed the size of the prison population in the United States\\n\\nWhat do you think of those two

percent of all of our prisoners only 17 percent of the inmates are there primarily for drug charges And about twothirds are there for either property or violent crimes\\n\\nHas the percentage of drug offenders among the prison population been higher in the past\\n\\nIt peaked in 1990 at 22 percent and then steadily declined So even when the percentage of drug offenders among the state prison population was at its peak about four out of every five people were there for a nondrug offense\\n\\nWhy are you skeptical of the idea that longer sentences have been a significant driver of the prison boom\\n\\nIf you released every person in prison on a drug charge today our state prison population would drop from about 15 million to 12 million\\n\\nBecause while its true that legislators have passed a lot of longer sentences if you actually look at time served by inmates in prison it doesnt appear to have changed that much We have good data going back approximately 20 years or so and at least in northern and northwestern states where we have better data about half of all prisoners who get admitted in a given year only spend about two or three years in prison And only about 10

not the drug war and its not harsh sentencing laws what is it What do you think caused the prison boom\\n\\nYou need to break the question into two periods Because theres a time between 1975 and 1991 when you see this dramatic rise in crime and the prison population went up as well And then theres a more interesting period between 1991 and 2010 when crime steadily declined yet prison populations kept going up So between 75 and 91 its almost certain that the increase in crime had to play at least some significant role in increasing the prison population The scale of the crime boom that took place was dramatic From 1960 to 1991 violent crime rose by 400 percent and property crime rose by 200 percent Figuring out how much of prison growth can be attributed to the crime boom is actually statistically quite difficult but the best estimate thats out therewhich is not a perfect estimate but its the best we havesuggests that about half of prison growth during that period was due to rising crime Clearly other stuff mattered but rising crime played a very big role during the first phase\\n\\nSo why did the prison population keep on rising after 1991 when the crime wave ended It seems like if your theory is right that the increase in violent crime and property crime caused the prison boom the end of the crime wave should have been accompanied by decreasing incarceration rates\\n\\nThree things could have happened One police just got much more efficienttheyre just arresting more and more people with new policing technologies new policing approachesmaybe theyre just arresting a bigger share of offenders But we dont actually see that Arrests tend to drop with the crime rate So the total number of people being arrested has fallen The other thing it could be is were just locking people up for longerbut like I said its not that So clearly whats happening is were just admitting more people to prison Though we have a smaller pool of people being arrested were sending a larger and larger number of them to prison\\n\\nWhy would that be\\n\\nWhat appears to happen during this timethe years I look at are 1994 to 2008 just based on the data thats availableis that the probability that a district attorney files a felony charge against an arrestee goes from about 1 in 3 to 2 in 3 So over the course of the 90s and 2000s district attorneys just got much more aggressive in how they filed charges Defendants who they would not have filed felony charges against before they now are charging with felonies I cant tell you why theyre doing that No ones really got an answer to that yet But it does seem that the number of felony cases filed shoots up very strongly even as the number of arrests goes down\\n\\nIsnt the traditional explanation for why prosecutors tend to be overzealous is that their political careers depend on it\\n\\nThe political question is interesting because generally the district attorney election is not very difficult to win DAs tend to win elections pretty regularly So when Joe Hynes was defeated in the Democratic primary in Brooklyn New York in 2012 he was the first sitting Brooklyn DA to run for reelection and lose in more than a century But thats not to say that politics dont matter Maybe its that next election theyre looking at that they remain tough on crime because they want to become attorney general or governor Theres no clear data on this Were only just starting to look at this question But that strikes me as a possible story What might have happened is the crime boom made being a prosecutor more of a launchpad positionit elevated the status of prosecutors and perhaps elevated their political ambitions and they remained tough on crime even as crime started going down\\n\\nOK So why does any of this matter Why is it important for reformers to have the right theory for why mass incarceration happened\\n\\nThe reason its important to get it right is that if were trying to reduce the prison population we want to make sure we do it correctlyand if you focus on the wrong thing you wont solve the problem So if you think its the war on drugs you might think OK if we just decriminalize drugs that will solve the problem And you know its true that if we shift away from punishment to treatment that could be a huge improvement But just letting people out of prisondecarcerating drug offenderswill not reduce the prison population by as much as people think If you released every person in prison on a drug charge today our state prison population would drop from about 15 million to 12 million So wed still be the worlds largest incarcerating country wed still have an enormous prison population\\n\\nAnd if we focused on cutting back sentence lengths maybe that would weaken DAs bargaining power at plea bargaining but since people arent serving the massively long sentences anyway it probably wont have that big an effect on prison population either\\n\\nWhat would\\n\\nWell the real growth in the prison population comes from countylevel district attorneys sending violent people to prison And theres a lot to be said for nonprison approaches to a lot of people who are in prison for violent crimes But thats a political issue that we havent even begun to address in part because its politically scary\\n\\nWhere does that leave reformers who want to see the prison population drop significantly\\n\\nWhat makes it very hard is that the person we really need to target nowwhose behavior we need to regulateis the district attorney and the district attorney is a very politically independent figure Hes directly elected and hes directly elected at the county level So theres no big centralized fix You cant necessarily go to Washington and say Heres the law thats going to control what the DAs do because they dont have to listen to the federal government at all So you have to figure out how to go county by county and either elect DAs who have less punitive attitudes or you can try to sort of change the incentives DAs face at the state level But its very tricky\\n\\nThis interview has been edited and condensed\", \"Text_NoStopwords\": \"photo justin sullivangetty images criminal justice reform contentious political issue theres one point pretty much everyone agrees americas prison population way high possible decline already begun number state federal inmates dropping three years straight starting 2010 alltime high 162 million 2009 157 million 2012 change slow even downward trend continues far guaranteed could take almost 90 years countrys prison population get 1980 unless rate decline speeds significantly leon neyfakh leon neyfakh slate staff writer done make population drop faster many reformers operating assumption mass incarceration first foremost result war drugs focused making drug laws less punitive getting rid draconian sentencing laws require judges impose impossibly harsh punishments people committed relatively minor crimes according john pfaff professor fordham law school neither efforts make significant dent problem based false understanding prison boom happened first place analyzed statistics goes prison long pfaff emerged new provocative account problem mass incarceration came hes right implications prison reform movement huge suggest work needed achieve real progress much harder people realize conversation slate pfaff explains theory advertisement us prison population increased fivefold 1980 2009from approximately 320000 inmates 162 million look work scholars policymakers influenced see dominant explanations happened one sending people prison time war drugsthat weve made concerted effort target people drug dealing drug possession filling prisons drugrelated offenses dominant view two changes transformed size prison population united states think two explanations understand come true legislators passed lot new tougher sentencing laws past 30 40 years true increased attention paid drugs end things play much much bigger role explaining prison growth fact matter todays state prisons hold 90 percent prisoners 17 percent inmates primarily drug charges twothirds either property violent crimes percentage drug offenders among prison population higher past peaked 1990 22 percent steadily declined even percentage drug offenders among state prison population peak four every five people nondrug offense skeptical idea longer sentences significant driver prison boom released every person prison drug charge today state prison population would drop 15 million 12 million true legislators passed lot longer sentences actually look time served inmates prison doesnt appear changed much good data going back approximately 20 years least northern northwestern states better data half prisoners get admitted given year spend two three years prison 10 percent serve seven eight years prison laws look incredibly punitive25 years class b felonybut dont see people serving amount time ok drug war harsh sentencing laws think caused prison boom need break question two periods theres time 1975 1991 see dramatic rise crime prison population went well theres interesting period 1991 2010 crime steadily declined yet prison populations kept going 75 91 almost certain increase crime play least significant role increasing prison population scale crime boom took place dramatic 1960 1991 violent crime rose 400 percent property crime rose 200 percent figuring much prison growth attributed crime boom actually statistically quite difficult best estimate thats therewhich perfect estimate best havesuggests half prison growth period due rising crime clearly stuff mattered rising crime played big role first phase prison population keep rising 1991 crime wave ended seems like theory right increase violent crime property crime caused prison boom end crime wave accompanied decreasing incarceration rates three things could happened one police got much efficienttheyre arresting people new policing technologies new policing approachesmaybe theyre arresting bigger share offenders dont actually see arrests tend drop crime rate total number people arrested fallen thing could locking people longerbut like said clearly whats happening admitting people prison though smaller pool people arrested sending larger larger number prison would appears happen timethe years look 1994 2008 based data thats availableis probability district attorney files felony charge arrestee goes 1 3 2 3 course 90s 2000s district attorneys got much aggressive filed charges defendants would filed felony charges charging felonies cant tell theyre ones really got answer yet seem number felony cases filed shoots strongly even number arrests goes isnt traditional explanation prosecutors tend overzealous political careers depend political question interesting generally district attorney election difficult win das tend win elections pretty regularly joe hynes defeated democratic primary brooklyn new york 2012 first sitting brooklyn da run reelection lose century thats say politics dont matter maybe next election theyre looking remain tough crime want become attorney general governor theres clear data starting look question strikes possible story might happened crime boom made prosecutor launchpad positionit elevated status prosecutors perhaps elevated political ambitions remained tough crime even crime started going ok matter important reformers right theory mass incarceration happened reason important get right trying reduce prison population want make sure correctlyand focus wrong thing wont solve problem think war drugs might think ok decriminalize drugs solve problem know true shift away punishment treatment could huge improvement letting people prisondecarcerating drug offenderswill reduce prison population much people think released every person prison drug charge today state prison population would drop 15 million 12 million wed still worlds largest incarcerating country wed still enormous prison population focused cutting back sentence lengths maybe would weaken das bargaining power plea bargaining since people arent serving massively long sentences anyway probably wont big effect prison population either would well real growth prison population comes countylevel district attorneys sending violent people prison theres lot said nonprison approaches lot people prison violent crimes thats political issue havent even begun address part politically scary leave reformers want see prison population drop significantly makes hard person really need target nowwhose behavior need regulateis district attorney district attorney politically independent figure hes directly elected hes directly elected county level theres big centralized fix cant necessarily go washington say heres law thats going control das dont listen federal government figure go county county either elect das less punitive attitudes try sort change incentives das face state level
