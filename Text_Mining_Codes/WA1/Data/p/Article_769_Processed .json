"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nThe U.S. Army is setfor the first timeto graduate two female soldiers from the Army Ranger School, the Army announced on Monday. The two female lieutenants, both in their 20s, successfully completed the Armys punishing nine-week training course and will graduate with the Ranger class on Friday.\\n\\nThe Army announced it was going to begin assessing incorporating women into its Ranger training earlier this year, and 19 women started the grueling, monthslong course that is a prerequisite to serve in the Armys elite special operations unit. Though they will have earned the prestigious Ranger Tab for having completed the course, the two women will not be eligible to try out to serve in the 75th Ranger Regiment as women are not yet allowed to serve in that special operations combat unit, according to the Associated Press. That could change early next year when Defense Secretary Ash Carter will decide whether to allow women to be eligible to serve in all combat units.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary of the Army John M. McHugh acknowledged the historic achievement:\\n\\nEach Ranger School graduate has shown the physical and mental toughness to successfully lead organizations at any level. This course has proven that every Soldier, regardless of gender, can achieve his or her full potential. We owe Soldiers the opportunity to serve successfully in any position where they are qualified and capable, and we continue to look for ways to select, train, and retain the best Soldiers to meet our Nation's needs.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"chip\"], [\"chip\", \"somodevillagetty\"], [\"somodevillagetty\", \"image\"], [\"image\", \"u\"], [\"u\", \"army\"], [\"army\", \"setfor\"],
