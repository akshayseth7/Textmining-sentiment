"{\"Text\": \"Courtesy of Sony Pictures\\n\\nThe words summer movie suggest an outsize spectacle involving CGI megalizards, sexy ninja warriors, and wanton destruction visited on the skylines of the worlds great cities. But there are other types of movie releases associated with the season, one of my perennial favorites being the Meryl Streep Summer Movie. (The enduringly charismatic Streep is, come to think of it, kind of a sexy ninja warrior herself.) The Devil Wears Prada was released in midsummer, as were Julie & Julia, Mamma Mia!, and Hope Springs. Streep summer movies tend to be light, often sentimental comedies that explore intergenerational conflict or family dysfunction while still sending viewers out of the theater on a note of warm uplift. Theyre movies you might plausibly take your grandmother to (though the geriatric sex-therapy scenes in Hope Springs could get awkward) and then talk about afterward over crepes at the mall.\\n\\nDana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.\\n\\nI have nothing against a good plate of mall crepes, and I wish my grandmothers were still around to see Ricki and the Flash. Jonathan Demmes uneven but ebullient film stars Streep as a sixtysomething rock musician named Ricki Rendazzo. (At least thats the name she insists on going by, though her drivers license IDs her more prosaically as Linda Brummel.) Ricki might be described as a washed-up rock star, had she ever had a real career to shipwreck and then wash up from. Her bar band, the Flash, has a longstanding weekly gig playing coversTom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, the occasional Lady Gaga or Pink tune-and they seem to have built a small but loyal following among the resolutely unhip patrons of the Salt Well in Tarzana, California. But Rickis only real source of income is her job as a cashier at Total Foodsa transparent Whole Foods stand-in, complete with stifling bourgie alienation. Though shes dating her guitarist Grega nicely cast Rick Springfield, whose scruffy, off-kilter sex appeal recalls a Robert Altman hero from the 70sRicki resists commitment, going so far as to belittle their relationship onstage in an ill-chosen bit of would-be banter.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon becomes clear, a lot of Rickis choices are ill ones. Shes just filed for bankruptcy and is more or less estranged from her family, having left her husband and three children decades before to pursue her music career. Her ex, Pete (Kevin Kline), has since remarried and become a successful businessman, the kind with rigid habits and tasteful monogrammed cardigans. When Pete calls to tell her that their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer, Streeps daughter in real life) has spun into depression after a failed marriage, Ricki somehow scrapes together the money to fly to Indianapolis, where the rest of her family still lives.\\n\\nToo broke to afford a hotel, Ricki inveigles her way into a guest room at the swanky McMansion Pete shares with his second wife, whos away at the moment caring for her own ailing father. In another bedroom nearby, the volatile Julie, who hasnt showered, changed her clothes, or combed her hair since arriving at her fathers house five days ago, lies in a state of vegetative torpor. The arrival of Julies less-than-beloved mother rouses her just enough to descend on her parents for a brief screaming match. Gummer, a dead ringer for her mother with a generally closer-to-the-vest performing style, makes a grand entrance into the movie on the shrieked line, Julie isnt looking forward to shit!\\n\\nThe first third of the movie is a fish-out-of-water comedy in which the raccoon-mascaraed, toe-ringed, compulsively irreverent Ricki tries to fit back in with a family whose languages and rhythms she no longer understands. One son (Sebastian Stan) is engaged to a pretty, conventional woman who seems quietly horrified to meet her fiances foul-mouthed progenitor. The other (Nick Westrate), whos gay, is resentful of his mothers long absence and what he sees as her latent homophobia.\\n\\nRicki is one of those people whose mere presence goads people into doing things they know they shouldnt. She urges the suicidal Julie to skip psychotherapy with the paradoxical exhortation to call in sick! She locates a stash of marijuana in Petes freezer and somehow convinces him to smoke some with her and their daughter, loosening him up so much he half-admits to still being in love with her. When Petes imperturbable wife Maureen (Audra McDonald) gets back home the next day, she politely but firmly insists that its time for Ricki to go. But when another family event calls Ricki back to Indianapolis, she must decide whats truly worth keeping, both from her old life and from the new one shes built for herself.\\n\\nThe screenplay (by Juno/Young Adult scribe Diablo Cody) doesnt lack for memorable zingers, and thanks to Codys script and Streeps performance, Ricki emerges as a complex, self-contradictory person (even if most of the supporting characters dont). A woman from a blue-collar background, she lost a brother in the Vietnam War and has been a fierce support-our-troops patriot ever since: Theres an enormous American flag tattooed across her back, and, as one of her painfully progressive children observes with distaste, she voted for George W. Bush twice. Rickis conservative political beliefsand the homophobia and racism we occasionally hear her give almost unconscious voice tomake for this movies most disappointing unexplored avenue. Petes second wife is blacka fact that, especially after we hear Ricki crack a bad Obama joke in the direction of her black keyboard player, seems likely to come into play in the story somehow, until it doesnt. I was nervously anticipating a moment in which some subplot about Rickis unacknowledged biases would be too clumsily handled; instead, the issue was dropped entirely, which felt even worse. A movie that could have been about more than the battles within one isolated middle-class family steered its course firmly in the direction of domestic dramedy and never looked back.\\n\\nRicki and the Flash may not be top-drawer Jonathan Demme, but it also doesnt come from the lowest drawer in the directors bureau, the one containing nothing but a few old pennies and The Truth About Charlie. Its a mixture of two things Demme at his best can excel at: the misfit comedy and the concert film. Its no Melvin and Howard or Something Wild, but like those movies it features a flawed yet lovable protagonist who learns to adapt to radically changing circumstances. And its no Stop Making Sense or Neil Young: Heart of Gold, but like those movies it demonstrates a keen ear for music and a patient camera that allows singers whole, uninterrupted live performances in which to shine. Several important story developments are communicated entirely through song: As Ricki and her band dig into a cover of the Dobie Gray hit Drift Away, her changing mood tells us everything we need to know about whats going on behind those raccoon-ringed eyes. Streep learned how to play guitar for the role (presumably while listening to language tapes to teach herself Basque for her next one), and while her pipes may not be as virtuosic as those of her co-star, Broadway diva McDonald (who never gets to sing here!), Streep can communicate the emotional tenor of a song, and the joy of playing music itself, like nobodys business.\", \"Text_Bigrams\":
