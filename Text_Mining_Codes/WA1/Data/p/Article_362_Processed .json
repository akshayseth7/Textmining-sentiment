Well, maybe. Despite a few memorable moments of intense realism on the global stage, world leaders have essentially done nothing. Existential dread is fairly common among those who work on climate change on a daily basis.\\n\\nThats the theme Esquires John H. Richardson explored this week in a fascinating and frank discussion with Jason Box and other climate scientists. Ive had my own run-ins with climate change despair, and this article strikes me as a fascinating insight into the psychology of an increasingly apocalyptic science. You should read the whole thing, but here are some highlights. Richardson describes Box as oddly detached from the things hes saying, laying out one horrible prediction after another without emotion, as if he were an anthropologist regarding the life cycle of a distant civilization.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that doesnt mean Box is unfeeling. In a photo caption, Richardson reveals the money quote highlighting Boxs ever-present malaise: The customary scientific role is to deal dispassionately with data, but Box says that the shit thats going down is testing my ability to block it. \\n\\nIn the face of all this, Box and his family relocated from the United States to Denmark. Richardson explains their decision:\\n\\nHis daughter is three and a half, and Denmark is a great place to be in an uncertain worldtheres plenty of water, a high-tech agriculture system, increasing adoption of wind power, and plenty of geographic distance from the coming upheavals. Especially when you consider the beginning of the flood of desperate people from conflict and drought, he says, returning to his obsession with how profoundly changed our civilization will be.\\n\\nIn fact, Box often thinks about the profound planetary changes that are already underway:\\n\\nHis home state of Colorado isnt doing so great, either. The forests are dying, and they will not return. The trees wont return to a warming climate. Were going to see megafires even more, thatll be the new onemegafires until those forests are cleared.\\n\\nBut the real success of the Richardson piece is the way he depicts the internal struggle Box deals with on a daily basis.\\n\\nBut IIIm not letting it get to me. If I spend my energy on despair, I wont be thinking about opportunities to minimize the problem.\\n\\nHis insistence on this point is very unconvincing, especially given the solemnity that shrouds him like a dark coat. But the most interesting part is the insistence itselfthe desperate need not to be disturbed by something so disturbing.\\n\\nIn a moment of candor I hadnt seen before, Box revealed to Richardson that hes already preparing for the worst:\\n\\nIn Denmark, Box says, we have the resilience, so Im not that worried about my daughters livelihood going forward. But that doesnt stop me from strategizing about how to safeguard her futureIve been looking at property in Greenland. As a possible bug-out scenario.\\n\\nDespite what the Esquire article says, Box, whose work I have previously covered on Slate, is a bit of an outlier among climate scientists. Most of them arent as willing to talk about the plausibility of nightmare scenarios. Still, his frankness on climate change is welcome.\\n\\nUltimately, what scientists are after is truth, even if that truth is personally devastating. For that reason, being a climate scientist is probably one of the most psychologically challenging jobs of the 21st century. As the Esquire article asks: How do you keep going when the end of human civilization is your day job?\\n\\nI reached out to a few well-known climate scientists for their reactions to the article.\\n\\nMichael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University meteorologist whom Richardson quotes, told me, I would emphasize that it isnt too late to act, despite the sense one might get from the article. Our only obstacle at present is willpower. When asked about how many climate scientists struggle with psychological dread over their studies, Mann said, I honestly dont know how many of my colleagues reflect on the matter. But those who dont ought to. What were studying and learning is more than just science. It has ramifications for the future of humanity and this planet.\\n\\nBy far the most engaging response was from Katharine Hayhoe, a rising star in the climate science community after her work engaging evangelical Christians on the issue was profiled in a Showtime documentary last year. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people on the planet for 2014.\\n\\nHayhoe now lives in Texas, precisely because of its climate vulnerability. Hayhoe said Texas strident political opposition to the reality makes it ground zero for climate change, which her work embraces. If I personally can make a difference, I feel like Texas is where I can do it. But shes quick to applaud Boxs work and doesnt criticize his familys decision to relocate.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"akhtar\"], [\"akhtar\", \"soomroreuters\"], [\"soomroreuters\",

screwed right Well maybe Despite a few memorable moments of intense realism on the global stage world leaders have essentially done nothing Existential dread is fairly common among those who work on climate change on a daily basis\\n\\nThats the theme Esquires John H Richardson explored this week in a fascinating and frank discussion with Jason Box and other climate scientists Ive had my own runins with climate change despair and this article strikes me as a fascinating insight into the psychology of an increasingly apocalyptic science You should read the whole thing but here are some highlights Richardson describes Box as oddly detached from the things hes saying laying out one horrible prediction after another without emotion as if he were an anthropologist regarding the life cycle of a distant civilization\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that doesnt mean Box is unfeeling In a photo caption Richardson reveals the money quote highlighting Boxs everpresent malaise The customary scientific role is to deal dispassionately with data but Box says that the shit thats going down is testing my ability to block it \\n\\nIn the face of all this Box and his family relocated from the United States to Denmark Richardson explains their decision\\n\\nHis daughter is three and a half and Denmark is a great place to be in an uncertain worldtheres plenty of water a hightech agriculture system increasing adoption of wind power and plenty of geographic distance from the coming upheavals Especially when you consider the beginning of the flood of desperate people from conflict and drought he says returning to his obsession with how profoundly changed our civilization will be\\n\\nIn fact Box often thinks about the profound planetary changes that are already underway\\n\\nHis home state of Colorado isnt doing so great either The forests are dying and they will not return The trees wont return to a warming climate Were going to see megafires even more thatll be the new onemegafires until those forests are cleared\\n\\nBut the real success of the Richardson piece is the way he depicts the internal struggle Box deals with on a daily basis\\n\\nBut IIIm not letting it get to me If I spend my energy on despair I wont be thinking about opportunities to minimize the problem\\n\\nHis insistence on this point is very unconvincing especially given the solemnity that shrouds him like a dark coat But the most interesting part is the insistence itselfthe desperate need not to be disturbed by something so disturbing\\n\\nIn a moment of candor I hadnt seen before Box revealed to Richardson that hes already preparing for the worst\\n\\nIn Denmark Box says we have the resilience so Im not that worried about my daughters livelihood going forward But that doesnt stop me from strategizing about how to safeguard her futureIve been looking at property in Greenland As a possible bugout scenario\\n\\nDespite what the Esquire article says Box whose work I have previously covered on Slate is a bit of an outlier among climate scientists Most of them arent as willing to talk about the plausibility of nightmare scenarios Still his frankness on climate change is welcome\\n\\nUltimately what scientists are after is truth even if that truth is personally devastating For that reason being a climate scientist is probably one of the most psychologically challenging jobs of the 21st century As the Esquire article asks How do you keep going when the end of human civilization is your day job\\n\\nI reached out to a few wellknown climate scientists for their reactions to the article\\n\\nMichael Mann a Pennsylvania State University meteorologist whom Richardson quotes told me I would emphasize that it isnt too late to act despite the sense one might get from the article Our only obstacle at present is willpower When asked about how many climate scientists struggle with psychological dread over their studies Mann said I honestly dont know how many of my colleagues reflect on the matter But those who dont ought to What were studying and learning is more than just science It has ramifications for the future of humanity and this planet\\n\\nBy far the most engaging response was from Katharine Hayhoe a rising star in the climate science community after her work engaging evangelical Christians on the issue was profiled in a Showtime documentary last year Time named her one of the 100 most influential people on the planet for 2014\\n\\nHayhoe now lives in Texas precisely because of its climate vulnerability Hayhoe said Texas strident political opposition to the reality makes it ground zero for climate change which her work embraces If I personally can make a difference I feel like Texas is where I can do it But shes quick to applaud Boxs work and doesnt criticize his familys decision to relocate\", \"Text_NoStopwords\": \"photo akhtar soomroreuters photo ronen zvulunreuters photo dani pozoafpgetty images photo herman
