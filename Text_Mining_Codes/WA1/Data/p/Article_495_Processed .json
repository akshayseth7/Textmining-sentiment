"{\"Text\": \"Image: NASA\\n\\nAccording to new data released Friday from NASA and the Japanese Meteorological Agency, last month was the warmest October globally since official weather records have been kept in the late 1800s. According to NASA, last month tied with 2005 as the warmest October on record globally. Japans data show the month as significantly warmer than October 2003, its previously warmest October.\\n\\nThere wasnt such a thing as October the last time global temperatures were this warm, which recent research has dated to at least 4,000 years ago. That fact brings a bit of context to the litany of new worldwide temperature records set in whats shaping up to be an exceptionally warm 2014.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nApril was the first month in at least 800,000 years that atmospheric carbon dioxide reached 400 parts per million. Its this sudden surge of heat-trapping gases, released by human activities, thats driving climate change and pushing global temperatures to new highs.\\n\\nThe record-breaking probably isnt done yet. The persistence of off-the-charts ocean temperatures has helped push 2014 to the front of the pack, and its increasingly likely that records will continue to fall for the rest of the calendar year (and perhaps well into 2015). Climate Central has an interactive graphic using the latest NOAA data (through September) that illustrates the scenarios that would lead to a record-warm 2014. Considering NASAs newly released October data, Ive calculated that November and December need only be the third-warmest on record for this year to come out on top.\\n\\nThe string of records is all the more astounding given that El Ninoa periodic warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean linked to other record-warm years, like 1998, 2005, and 2010is sputtering to get started this year. If we no longer need a cyclical warming of Earths largest ocean to produce record-warm years, in my view, its a sign that global warming has entered a scary new phase.\", \"Text_Bigrams\":
