"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nWhen Bernie Sanders announced his campaign for president, I thought he would be a gadfly with a modest following. Not Howard Dean, but not Dennis Kucinich, either. During the past week, however, the Vermont senator has become a bona fide phenomenon.\\n\\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.\\n\\nTake last week, when the self-described socialist spoke to a packed arena in Madison, Wisconsin, detailing his plans to break up Wall Street and pass universal health care. At 10,000 people, his crowd was the largest of any candidate in the presidential race so far: Hillary Clinton drew 5,500 people to her speech on Roosevelt Island in New York City, while Jeb Bush drew just 3,000 people to his announcement event at Miami Dade College in Florida. (Sen. Ted Cruz spoke to 11,000 students at Liberty University, but they had to be thereCruz announced at the schools convocation, which is mandatory for students living on campus.) Before Madison, Sanders spoke to a packed auditorium of 700 people in Iowa, and before that, he spoke to 5,000 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\\n\\nAfter the crowds, theres the polls. In the vital primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders takes 33 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Hes far from aheadClinton has 52 percent and 51 percentbut its a strong showing nonetheless.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd after the polls, theres the cash. Since joining the Democratic race in April, Sanders has raised $15 million from nearly 250,000 donors, compared with Clintons haul of $45 million. For comparisons sake, thats more than Sanders has raised in either of his two Senate campaigns combined, and just $7 million short of all the cash Sanders has raised in his entire career as a politician, from 1989 to the present.\\n\\nIn just a few months, Sanders has moved from the periphery of American politics to the mainstream, as the most visible and popular alternative to Clinton, vastly outpacing former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who recently announced his candidacy. But visibility isnt viability, and theres almost no chance Sanders will become the Democratic Partys presidential nominee, even if he sustains his momentum into next year.\\n\\nDespite the polls and the voting, presidential primaries arent popularity contests. Instead, theyre closer to negotiations, where interests and individuals work to choose a leader and representative for the entire group. That person has to appeal to everyone, from ideological factions and political power centers to wealthy donors and ordinary voters and activists. The candidate also has to show that he or she can do the work of a national campaign, from winning debates to raising money.\\n\\nClinton has done this. She came close to winning the 2008 nomination and spent the next seven yearsright up to the presentbuilding her stature in Democratic politics. A moderate liberal committed to most of Barack Obamas domestic and foreign policy agenda, shes acceptable to almost everyone in the partyin a national poll of the Democratic field from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, she has a whopping 75 percent of the vote.\\n\\nWhich brings us back to Bernie. Sanders is a fascinating candidate with a vital, underrepresented message in American politics. But the same qualities that make him uniquerelative independence from the Democratic Party, a foundational critique of American politicsmake him unsuited for a major party nomination, much less the Democratic one. The more moderate and conservative parts of the Democratic coalition wont support a left-wing candidate like Sanders, and the more strategic votersparty stalwarts like black Americanswill be skeptical that Sanders could win the White House, even if they agree with his ideas and policies.\\n\\nTo appeal to the party overall, and not just an ideological faction, Sanders would have to tailor himself to the priorities of the Democratic coalition beyond its most liberal members. But the cost of that change is to shed the things that make him unique. And Sanders knows it. Its why he wont engage in traditional fundraisingits hard to speak truth to power when youre catering to millionaire fundraisers.\\n\\nObama could beat Clinton and win the nomination because, in every crucial respect, he was a conventional Democrat with strong ties to the party establishment. He could capitalize on anti-Clinton discontent, tap into elite networks of activists and donors, and show stalwart votersand blacks in particularthat he was a realistic and viable alternative to the Clinton candidacy. So, when he won the Iowa caucus, he had more than the momentum of victoryhe had the support of a crucial bloc of the Democratic Party.*\\n\\nSanders, for all of his present success, doesnt have that. If he wins the Iowa caucus, he wont have the alliesor the institutional resourcesto turn a victory into a viable national strategy. Put differently, if Clinton lost the Iowa caucus, thenas one Democratic strategist told the New York Timesher team would just ride out the punditry and people with their hair on fire and capture the nomination. With the establishment on your side, you can lose and still win.\\n\\nSanders wont be the Democratic nominee. But that doesnt mean he wont be important. Here, its useful to think of Ron Paul, the former Republican representative who ran for the GOP nomination in 2008 and 2012. Paul drew large crowds and raised huge sums for his campaign but couldnt translate that success into votes. Nonetheless, his splash mattered. He helped bridge the divide between libertarians and the Republican right, and he inspired a new group of conservative and libertarian activists who have made a mark in the GOP through Pauls son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\\n\\nIf Sanders can sustain and capture the left-wing enthusiasm for his campaign, he could do the same for progressives. He could bring their issues onto a presidential debate stage and into the Democratic mainstream, and bring them into the process itself. No, Democrats wont change overnight, but with time and effort, the Sanders revolution could bear real fruit.\\n\\nSee more of Slates coverage of the 2016 campaign.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\",

thought he would be a gadfly with a modest following not howard dean but not dennis kucinich either during the past week however the vermont senator has become a bona fide phenomenon\\n\\njamelle bouie jamelle bouie is slates chief political correspondent\\n\\ntake last week when the selfdescribed socialist spoke to a packed arena in madison wisconsin detailing his plans to break up wall street and pass universal health care at 10000 people his crowd was the largest of any candidate in the presidential race so far hillary clinton drew 5500 people to her speech on roosevelt island in new york city while jeb bush drew just 3000 people to his announcement event at miami dade college in florida sen ted cruz spoke to 11000 students at liberty university but they had to be therecruz announced at the schools convocation which is mandatory for students living on campus before madison sanders spoke to a packed auditorium of 700 people in iowa and before that he spoke to 5000 in minneapolis minnesota\\n\\nafter the crowds theres the polls in the vital primary states of iowa and new hampshire sanders takes 33 percent and 31 percent respectively hes far from aheadclinton has 52 percent and 51 percentbut its a strong showing nonetheless\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nand after the polls theres the cash since joining the democratic race in april sanders has raised 15 million from nearly 250000 donors compared with clintons haul of 45 million for comparisons sake thats more than sanders has raised in either of his two senate campaigns combined and just 7 million short of all the cash sanders has raised in his entire career as a politician from 1989 to the present\\n\\nin just a few months sanders has moved from the periphery of american politics to the mainstream as the most visible and popular alternative to clinton vastly outpacing former maryland gov martin omalley and former virginia sen jim webb who recently announced his candidacy but visibility isnt viability and theres almost no chance sanders will become the democratic partys presidential nominee even if he sustains his momentum into next year\\n\\ndespite the polls and the voting presidential primaries arent popularity contests instead theyre closer to negotiations where interests and individuals work to choose a leader and representative for the entire group that person has to appeal to everyone from ideological factions and political power centers to wealthy donors and ordinary voters and activists the candidate also has to show that he or she can do the work of a national campaign from winning debates to raising money\\n\\nclinton has done this she came close to winning the 2008 nomination and spent the next seven yearsright up to the presentbuilding her stature in democratic politics a moderate liberal committed to most of barack obamas domestic and foreign policy agenda shes acceptable to almost everyone in the partyin a national poll of the democratic field from nbc

president I thought he would be a gadfly with a modest following Not Howard Dean but not Dennis Kucinich either During the past week however the Vermont senator has become a bona fide phenomenon\\n\\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slates chief political correspondent\\n\\nTake last week when the selfdescribed socialist spoke to a packed arena in Madison Wisconsin detailing his plans to break up Wall Street and pass universal health care At 10000 people his crowd was the largest of any candidate in the presidential race so far Hillary Clinton drew 5500 people to her speech on Roosevelt Island in New York City while Jeb Bush drew just 3000 people to his announcement event at Miami Dade College in Florida Sen Ted Cruz spoke to 11000 students at Liberty University but they had to be thereCruz announced at the schools convocation which is mandatory for students living on campus Before Madison Sanders spoke to a packed auditorium of 700 people in Iowa and before that he spoke to 5000 in Minneapolis Minnesota\\n\\nAfter the crowds theres the polls In the vital primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire Sanders takes 33 percent and 31 percent respectively Hes far from aheadClinton has 52 percent and 51 percentbut its a strong showing nonetheless\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd after the polls theres the cash Since joining the Democratic race in April Sanders has raised 15 million from nearly 250000 donors compared with Clintons haul of 45 million For comparisons sake thats more than Sanders has raised in either of his two Senate campaigns combined and just 7 million short of all the cash Sanders has raised in his entire career as a politician from 1989 to the present\\n\\nIn just a few months Sanders has moved from the periphery of American politics to the mainstream as the most visible and popular alternative to Clinton vastly outpacing former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley and former Virginia Sen Jim Webb who recently announced his candidacy But visibility isnt viability and theres almost no chance Sanders will become the Democratic Partys presidential nominee even if he sustains his momentum into next year\\n\\nDespite the polls and the voting presidential primaries arent popularity contests Instead theyre closer to negotiations where interests and individuals work to choose a leader and representative for the entire group That person has to appeal to everyone from ideological factions and political power centers to wealthy donors and ordinary voters and activists The candidate also has to show that he or she can do the work of a national campaign from winning debates to raising money\\n\\nClinton has done this She came close to winning the 2008 nomination and spent the next seven yearsright up to the presentbuilding her stature in Democratic politics A moderate liberal committed to most of Barack Obamas domestic and foreign policy agenda shes acceptable to almost everyone in the partyin a national poll of the Democratic field from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal she has a whopping 75 percent of the vote\\n\\nWhich brings us back to Bernie Sanders is a fascinating candidate with a vital
