"{\"Text\": \"Screenshot via Google\\n\\nOver the past few years, the Supreme Court has welcomed an unprecedented number of nonhumans into the personhood club. First, the court held that corporations and labor unions were legally people and could spend unlimited sums on electioneering. Then it ruled that pharmaceutical companies have a First Amendment right to data mining. And just last summer, the court decided that an arts and crafts chain was effectively a person who had a religious right to deny employees birth control.\\n\\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\\n\\nGiven this legal trend, its really no surprise that Google would get in on the fun. In a recent case, the search engine giant argued that its search resultsselected entirely by a computerized algorithmare free speech and deserve full First Amendment protection. Last week, a California judge agreed that the coding of Googles algorithm is constitutionally protected activity and tossed out a lawsuit against the search engine. Computers are people, my friend.\\n\\nGoogle has actually been developing its First Amendment defense since at least 2003, fine-tuning it through a series of antitrust lawsuits by disgruntled companies that ignored Reese Witherspoons sage counsel and Googled themselves. The companies expected to see their websites at the top of the results but instead they wound up a few spots down, orhorrificallyon the second page. Irked by their perceived Internet obscurity, the companies then filed antitrust lawsuits against Google, arguing that the search engine was manipulating its results to favor certain companies and stifle competition.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThis accusation is nothing new, and Google has long insisted that it doesnt engineer its algorithm to boost certain companies rankings. But antitrust suits are incredibly expensive to litigate, and a nasty legal battle could tarnish Googles image in the public eye. So instead of fighting the antitrust suits on their own terms, Google decided to claim that they represented an unconstitutional encroachment on Googles free speech.\\n\\nIn its early years, Google had a mixed record with this argument; sometimes it won, but sometimes it lost under the theory that a private companys data had nothing to do with the First Amendment. Lately, however, the company has been on a winning streak, with the conventional wisdom settling around the notion that search results count as free speech. Googles latest victory is probably its most satisfying: In his one-paragraph ruling, the California judge didnt even feel compelled to explain why search results are protected.\\n\\nOne major reason the courts came around to this far-from-obvious conclusion is that Google got much better at making its own constitutional case. Thats because the search engine commissioned Eugene Volokh, law professorcumlegal celebrity, to co-author a lucid white paper explaining the precise reasoning behind the First Amendment claim. Volokh argues that the companys search results reflect individual editorial choices about both opinions and factstwo categories of speech that enjoy full First Amendment protection. By select[ing] what information it presents and how it presents it, Google is exercising classic free speech, not unlike a newspaper editor might.\\n\\nAll of that seems clearly correct. But what about the most basic component of the search engineits algorithm? Once Google has written its algorithm, it simply runs automatically, sifting through data and ordering it in a certain way. This act doesnt involve any human judgment; it doesnt even involve a human. How do these sophisticated computerized algorithms, in Volokhs description, engage in anything close to speech?\\n\\nA few years ago, this question wouldve been a constitutional stumper. But in a 2011 case called Sorrell v. IMS Health, the Supreme Court erected bold new First Amendment protections for data. Sorrell involved a Vermont law that forbade doctors from selling prescription data to drug companies. The pharmaceutical companies argued that the law violated their First Amendment rights to access and distribute data. In an emphatic ruling, the courts five conservativesjoined, surprisingly, by the liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayorstruck down the Vermont law. By restricting the exchange of data, the court held, Vermont was actually limiting the creation and dissemination of information. And there is thus a strong argument, the court asserted, that information is speech.\\n\\nVery few people paid close attention to Sorrell when it came down. Yet with its declaration that data is information and information is speech, the case may have a profound impact on the First Amendment in the digital age. Before Sorrell, Google could easily argue that its actual search results qualified as speech. But it would have struggled to claim that its algorithm was also speech and that the government could not constitutionally enforce a ruling demanding that it be modified. After Sorrell, the whole kit and caboodle is protected by the First Amendment. Googles algorithm may be performed by a computer, but by taking in data and churning out information, the computers are partaking in constitutionally protected free speech activity.\\n\\nEurope gives this theory the side-eye. Last May, the European Court of Justice implemented a right to be forgotten, which allows private citizens to request that search engines hide results that pertain to their pasts. Canada has also hopped aboard the Google censorship train; last June, Supreme Court of British Columbia asserted a right to censor Google search results not just in Canada but anywhere in the world. In these countries, freedom of speech is more of a suggestion than a command, a nice idea that still has to be balanced against a bevy of government interests. When those interests involve privacy or antitrust laws, a search engines free speech claims are probably going to fail.\\n\\nIn the United States, of course, we do things differently, which is generally a good thing. By giving wide berth to what counts as speech, the Supreme Court has protected the rights of pornographers, picketers, and flag-burnersas well as corporations, data miners, and, it appears, search engines. (Perhaps the court will soon tackle the free speech rights of robots, too.) The justices are so dedicated to the uninhibited flow of information that theyll smack down any attempt to staunch it, even if that means protecting a corporations right to run data through a

welcomed an unprecedented number of nonhumans into the personhood club First the court held that corporations and labor unions were legally people and could spend unlimited sums on electioneering Then it ruled that pharmaceutical companies have a First Amendment right to data mining And just last summer the court decided that an arts and crafts chain was effectively a person who had a religious right to deny employees birth control\\n\\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate He covers the law and LGBTQ issues\\n\\nGiven this legal trend its really no surprise that Google would get in on the fun In a recent case the search engine giant argued that its search resultsselected entirely by a computerized algorithmare free speech and deserve full First Amendment protection Last week a California judge agreed that the coding of Googles algorithm is constitutionally protected activity and tossed out a lawsuit against the search engine Computers are people my friend\\n\\nGoogle has actually been developing its First Amendment defense since at least 2003 finetuning it through a series of antitrust lawsuits by disgruntled companies that ignored Reese Witherspoons sage counsel and Googled themselves The companies expected to see their websites at the top of the results but instead they wound up a few spots down orhorrificallyon the second page Irked by their perceived Internet obscurity the companies then filed antitrust lawsuits against Google arguing that the search engine was manipulating its results to favor certain companies and stifle competition\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThis accusation is nothing new and Google has long insisted that it doesnt engineer its algorithm to boost certain companies rankings But antitrust suits are incredibly expensive to litigate and a nasty legal battle could tarnish Googles image in the public eye So instead of fighting the antitrust suits on their own terms Google decided to claim that they represented an unconstitutional encroachment on Googles free speech\\n\\nIn its early years Google had a mixed record with this argument sometimes it won but sometimes it lost under the theory that a private companys data had nothing to do with the First Amendment Lately however the company has been on a winning streak with the conventional wisdom settling around the notion that search results count as free speech Googles latest victory is probably its most satisfying In his oneparagraph ruling the California judge didnt even feel compelled to explain why search results are protected\\n\\nOne major reason the courts came around to this farfromobvious conclusion is that Google got much better at making its own constitutional case Thats because the search engine commissioned Eugene Volokh law professorcumlegal celebrity to coauthor a lucid white paper explaining the precise reasoning behind the First Amendment claim Volokh argues that the companys search results reflect individual editorial choices about both opinions and factstwo categories of speech that enjoy full First Amendment protection By selecting what information it presents and how it presents it Google is exercising classic free speech not unlike a newspaper editor might\\n\\nAll of that seems clearly correct But what about the most basic component of the search engineits algorithm Once Google has written its algorithm it simply runs automatically sifting through data and ordering it in a certain way This act doesnt involve any human judgment it doesnt even involve a
