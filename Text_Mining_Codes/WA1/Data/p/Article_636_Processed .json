"{\"Text\": \"Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton told reporters at the U.N. that she chose to use a personal e-mail account because she thought it would be easier to use one device rather than two. (UN Web TV)\\n\\nHillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that \\\"it would have been probably smarter\\\" to use two e-mail accounts during her time as secretary of state. Here is a complete transcript of her remarks.\\n\\nI want to thank the United Nations for hosting today's events and putting the challenge of gender equality front and center on the international agenda. I'm especially pleased to have so many leaders here from the private sector standing shoulder to shoulder with advocates who have worked tirelessly for equality for decades.\\n\\nTwenty years ago, this was a lonelier struggle. Today, we mark the progress that has been made in the two decades since the international community gathered in Beijing and declared with one voice that human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights.\\n\\nAnd because of advances in health, education, and legal protections, we can say that there has never been a better time in history to be born female. Yet as the comprehensive new report, published by the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation this week makes clear, despite all this progress, when it comes to the full participation of women and girls, we're just not there yet.\\n\\nAs I said today, this remains the great unfinished business of the 21st century. And my passion for this fight burns as brightly today as it did 20 years ago.\\n\\nI want to comment on a matter in the news today regarding Iran. The president and his team are in the midst of intense negotiations. Their goal is a diplomatic solution that would close off Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb and give us unprecedented access and insight into Iran's nuclear program.\\n\\nNow, reasonable people can disagree about what exactly it will take to accomplish this objective, and we all must judge any final agreement on its merits.\\n\\nBut the recent letter from Republican senators was out of step with the best traditions of American leadership. And one has to ask, what was the purpose of this letter?\\n\\nAt a news conference at the U.N. Tuesday, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton criticized a letter on negotiations over Iran's nuclear program signed by 47 Republican senators. (UN Web TV)\\n\\nThere appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the commander- in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer does discredit to the letters' signatories.\\n\\nNow, I would be pleased to talk more about this important matter, but I know there have been questions about my email, so I want to address that directly, and then I will take a few questions from you.\\n\\nThere are four things I want the public to know.\\n\\nFirst, when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\\n\\nREAD: Why couldn't Clinton have two e-mail accounts on one phone?\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.\\n\\nSecond, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.\\n\\nThird, after I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totalled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.\\n\\nNo one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.\\n\\nFourth, I took the unprecedented step of asking that the State Department make all my work-related emails public for everyone to see.\\n\\nI am very proud of the work that I and my colleagues and our public servants at the department did during my four years as secretary of state, and I look forward to people being able to see that for themselves.\\n\\nAgain, looking back, it would've been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts. I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way.\\n\\nNow I'm happy to take a few questions.\\n\\nQUESTION: Secretary Clinton, can you...\\n\\nCLINTON: Just a minute. Nick (ph) is calling on people.\\n\\nQUESTION: Sorry.\\n\\nMadam Secretary, Kahraman Haliscelik with Turkish Television. On behalf of the U.N. Correspondence Association, thank you very much for your remarks, and it's wonderful to see you here again.\\n\\nMadam Secretary, why did you opt out not using two devices at the time? Obviously, if this didn't come out, you wouldn't -- probably wouldn't become an issue.\\n\\nQUESTION: And my -- my second follow-up question is, if you were a man today, would all this fuss being made be made?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I will -- I will leave that to others to answer.\\n\\nBut as I -- as I said, I saw it as a matter of convenience, and it was allowed. Others had done it. According to the State Department, which recently said Secretary Kerry was the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov e-mail account.\\n\\nAnd when I got there, I wanted to just use one device for both personal and work e-mails, instead of two. It was allowed. And as I said, it was for convenience. And it was my practice to communicate with State Department and other government officials on their .gov accounts so those e-mails would be automatically saved in the State Department system to meet recordkeeping requirements, and that, indeed, is what happened.\\n\\nAnd I heard just a little while ago the State Department announced they would begin to post some of my e-mails, which I'm very glad to hear, because I want it all out there.\\n\\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, can you...\\n\\nCLINTON: Andrea? Andrea, thank you, Andrea.\\n\\nQUESTION: Can you explain how you decided which of the personal e-mails to get rid of, how you got rid of them and when? And how you'll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release?\\n\\nAnd, secondly, could you answer the questions that have been raised about foreign contributions from Middle Eastern countries, like Saudi Arabia, that abuse women or permit violence against women to the family foundation and whether that disturbs you as you are rightly celebrating 20 years of leadership on this issue?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, those are two very different questions. Let me see if I can take them in order. And I'll give you some of the background.\\n\\nIn going through the e-mails, there were over 60,000 in total, sent and received. About half were work-related and went to the State Department and about half were personal that were not in any way related to my work. I had no reason to save them, but that was my decision because the federal guidelines are clear and the State Department request was clear.\\n\\nFor any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. I am very confident of the process that we conducted and the e-mails that were produced.\\n\\nAnd I feel like once the American public begins to see the e- mails, they will have an unprecedented insight into a high government official's daily communications, which I think will be quite interesting.\\n\\nWith respect to the foundation, I am very proud of the work the foundation does. I'm very proud of the hundreds of thousands of people who support the work of the foundation and the results that have been achieved for people here at home and around the world.\\n\\nAnd I think that we are very clear about where we stand, certainly where I stand, on all of these issues. There can't be any mistake about my passion concerning women's rights here at home and around the world.\\n\\nSo I think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what we're working on.\\n\\nCLINTON: Hi, right here.\\n\\nQUESTION: Secretary Clinton?\\n\\nCLINTON: She's sort of squashed, so we've got to...\\n\\nQUESTION: Hi, Secretary.\\n\\nCLINTON: Hi.\\n\\nQUESTION: I was wondering if you think that you made a mistake either in exclusively using your private e-mail or in response to the controversy around it. And, if so, what have you learned from that?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I have to tell you that, as I said in my remarks, looking back, it would have been probably, you know, smarter to have used two devices. But I have absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department.\\n\\nAnd I have to add, even if I had had two devices, which is obviously permitted -- many people do that -- you would still have to put the responsibility where it belongs, which is on the official. So I did it for convenience and I now, looking back, think that it might have been smarter to have those two devices from the very beginning.\\n\\nQUESTION: Secretary Clinton?\\n\\nCLINTON: Yes? QUESTION: Did you or any of your aides delete any government- related e-mails from your personal account? And what lengths are you willing to go to to prove that you didn't?\\n\\nSome people, including supporters of yours, have suggested having an independent arbiter look at your server, for instance.\\n\\nCLINTON: We did not. In fact, my direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean they will be by the State Department once the State Department goes through them, but out of an abundance of caution and care, you know, we wanted to send that message unequivocally.\\n\\nThat is the responsibility of the individual and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubt that we have done exactly what we should have done. When the search was conducted, we were asking that any email be identified and preserved that could potentially be federal records, and that's exactly what we did.\\n\\nAnd we went, as I said, beyond that. And the process produced over 30,000 you know, work emails, and I think that we have more than met the requests from the State Department. The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private and I think that the State Department will be able, over time, to release all of the records that were provided.\\n\\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, can you...\\n\\nCLINTON: Right there.\\n\\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, two quick follow ups. You mentioned the server. That's one of the distinctions here.\\n\\nThis wasn't Gmail or Yahoo or something. This was a server that you owned. Is that appropriate? Is it -- was there any precedent for it? Did you clear it with any State Department security officials? And do they have -- did they have full access to it when you were secretary?\\n\\nAnd then separately, will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president? Thank you.\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, the system we used was set up for President Clinton's office. And it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.\\n\\nSo, I think that the -- the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure. Now, with respect to any sort of future -- future issues, look, I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters. And I feel that I've taken unprecedented steps to provide these work-related emails. They're going to be in the public domain. And I think that Americans will find that you know, interesting, and I look forward to having a discussion about that.\\n\\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary?\\n\\nCLINTON: Hi.\\n\\nQUESTION: How could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature, that you didn't also delete emails that were professional, but possibly unflattering?\\n\\nAnd what do you think about this Republican idea of having an independent third party come in an examine your emails?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee, because the way the system works, the federal employee, the individual, whether they have one device, two devices, three devices, how many addresses, they make the decision.\\n\\nSo, even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that. That is the way our system works. And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands, maybe millions of people to make those decisions.\\n\\nAnd I feel that I did that and even more, that I went above and beyond what I was requested to do. And again, those will be out in the public domain, and people will be able to judge for themselves.\\n\\nQUESTION: Okay, Madam.\\n\\nMadam Secretary?\\n\\nMadam Secretary, excuse me.\\n\\nMadam Secretary, State Department rules at the time you were secretary were perfectly clear that if a State Department employee was going to be using private email, that employee needed to turn those emails over to the State Department to be preserved on government computers.\\n\\nWhy did you not do that? Why did you not go along with State Department rules until nearly two years after you left office?\\n\\nQUESTION: And also, the president of the United States said that he was unaware that you had this unusual email arrangement. The White House counsel's office says that you never approved this arrangement through them.\\n\\nWhy did you not do that? Why did you -- why have you apparently caught the White House by surprise?\\n\\nAnd then just one last political question, if I -- I might. Does all of this make -- affect your decision in any way on whether or not to run for president?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, let me try to unpack your multiple questions.\\n\\nFirst, the laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed.\\n\\nSecondly, under the Federal Records Act, records are defined as reported information, regardless of its form or characteristics, and in meeting the record keeping obligations, it was my practice to email government officials on their state or other .gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved.\\n\\nNow, there are different rules governing the White House than there are governing the rest of the executive branch, and in order to address the requirements I was under, I did exactly what I have said. I emailed two people, and I not only knew, I expected that then to be captured in the State Department or any other government agency that I was emailing to at a .gov account.\\n\\nWhat happened in -- sorry, I guess late summer, early -- early fall, is that the State Department sent a letter to former secretaries of state, not just to me, asking for some assistance in providing any work-related emails that might be on the personal email.\\n\\nAnd what I did was to direct, you know, my counsel to conduct a thorough investigation and to err on the side of providing anything that could be connected to work. They did that, and that was my obligation. I fully fulfilled it, and then I took the unprecedented step of saying, \\\"Go ahead and release them, and let people see them.\\\"\\n\\nQUESTION: Why did you wait two months? Why -- why did you wait two months to turn those emails over? The rules say you have to turn them over...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK) CLINTON: I don't think -- I'd be happy to have somebody talk to you about the rules. I fully complied with every rule that I was governed by.\\n\\nQUESTION: Were you ever -- were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using -- using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?\\n\\nCLINTON: I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.\\n\\nSo I'm certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\\n\\nCLINTON: Because they were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people. They have nothing to do with work, but I didn't see any reason to keep them.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nQUESTION: At the end of the process.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nQUESTION: ... who was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails?\\n\\nBy the way, David Shuster from Al Jazeera America.\\n\\nCLINTON: Yeah. Right...\\n\\nQUESTION: What about Ambassador Scott (inaudible) being forced to resign?\\n\\nCLINTON: David, I think you should go online and read the entire I.G. report. That is not an accurate representation of what happened.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you.

be easier to use one device rather than two un web tv\\n\\nhillary rodham clinton said tuesday that it would have been probably smarter to use two email accounts during her time as secretary of state here is a complete transcript of her remarks\\n\\ni want to thank the united nations for hosting todays events and putting the challenge of gender equality front and center on the international agenda im especially pleased to have so many leaders here from the private sector standing shoulder to shoulder with advocates who have worked tirelessly for equality for decades\\n\\ntwenty years ago this was a lonelier struggle today we mark the progress that has been made in the two decades since the international community gathered in beijing and declared with one voice that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights\\n\\nand because of advances in health education and legal protections we can say that there has never been a better time in history to be born female yet as the comprehensive new report published by the clinton foundation and the gates foundation this week makes clear despite all this progress when it comes to the full participation of women and girls were just not there yet\\n\\nas i said today this remains the great unfinished business of the 21st century and my passion for this fight burns as brightly today as it did 20 years ago\\n\\ni want to comment on a matter in the news today regarding iran the president and his team are in the midst of intense negotiations their goal is a diplomatic solution that would close off irans pathways to a nuclear bomb and give us unprecedented access and insight into irans nuclear program\\n\\nnow reasonable people can disagree about what exactly it will take to accomplish this objective and we all must judge any final agreement on its merits\\n\\nbut the recent letter from republican senators was out of step with the best traditions of american leadership and one has to ask what was the purpose of this letter\\n\\nat a news conference at the un tuesday former secretary of state hillary clinton criticized a letter on negotiations over irans nuclear program signed by 47 republican senators un web tv\\n\\nthere appear to be two logical answers either these senators were trying to be helpful to the iranians or harmful to the commander inchief in the midst of highstakes international diplomacy either answer does discredit to the letters signatories\\n\\nnow i would be pleased to talk more about this important matter but i know there have been questions about my email so i want to address that directly and then i will take a few questions from you\\n\\nthere are four things i want the public to know\\n\\nfirst when i got to work as secretary of state i opted for convenience to use my personal email account which was allowed by the state department because i thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two\\n\\nread why couldnt clinton have two email accounts on one phone\\n\\n\\n\\nlooking back it wouldve been better if id simply used a second email account and carried a second phone but at the time this didnt seem like an issue\\n\\nsecond the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the state department\\n\\nthird after i left office the state department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work related emails from our personal accounts i responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be workrelated which totalled roughly 55000 printed pages even though i knew that the state department already had the vast majority of them we went through a thorough process to identify all of my work related emails and deliver them to the state department at the end i chose not to keep my private personal emails  emails about planning chelseas wedding or my mothers funeral arrangements condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines family vacations the other things you typically find in inboxes\\n\\nno one wants their personal emails made public and i think most people understand that and respect that privacy\\n\\nfourth i took the unprecedented step of asking that the state department make all my workrelated emails public for everyone to see\\n\\ni am very proud of the work that i and my colleagues and our public servants at the department did during my four years as secretary of state and i look forward to people being able to see that for themselves\\n\\nagain looking back it wouldve been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts i thought using one device would be simpler and obviously it hasnt worked out that way\\n\\nnow im happy to take a few questions\\n\\nquestion secretary clinton can you\\n\\nclinton just a minute nick ph is calling on people\\n\\nquestion sorry\\n\\nmadam secretary kahraman haliscelik with turkish television on behalf of the un correspondence association thank you very much for your remarks and its wonderful to see you here again\\n\\nmadam secretary why did you opt out not using two devices at the time obviously if this didnt come out you wouldnt  probably wouldnt become an issue\\n\\nquestion and my  my second followup question is if you were a man today would all this fuss being made be made\\n\\nthank you\\n\\nclinton well i will  i will leave that to others to answer\\n\\nbut as i  as i said i saw it as a matter of convenience and it was allowed others had done it according to the state department which recently said secretary kerry was the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a stategov email account\\n\\nand when i got there i wanted to just use one device for both personal and work emails instead of two it was allowed and as i said it was for convenience and it was my practice to communicate with state department and other government officials on their gov accounts so those emails would be automatically saved in the state department system to meet recordkeeping requirements and that indeed is what happened\\n\\nand i heard just a little while ago the state department announced they would begin to post some of my emails which im very glad to hear because i want it all out there\\n\\nquestion madam secretary can you\\n\\nclinton andrea andrea thank you andrea\\n\\nquestion can you explain how you decided which of the personal emails to get rid of how you got rid of them and when and how youll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release\\n\\nand secondly could you answer the questions that have been raised about foreign contributions from middle eastern countries like saudi arabia that abuse women or permit violence against women to the family foundation and whether that disturbs you as you are rightly celebrating 20 years of leadership on this issue\\n\\nclinton well those are two very different questions let me see if i can take them in order and ill give you some of the background\\n\\nin going through the emails there were over 60000 in total sent and received about half were workrelated and went to the state department and about half were personal that were not in any way related to my work i had no reason to save them but that was my decision because the federal guidelines are clear and the state department request was clear\\n\\nfor any government employee it is that government employees responsibility to determine whats personal and whats workrelated i am very confident of the process that we conducted and the emails that were produced\\n\\nand i feel like once the american public begins to see the e mails they will have an unprecedented insight into a high government officials daily communications which i think will be quite interesting\\n\\nwith respect to the foundation i am very proud of the work the foundation does im very proud of the hundreds of thousands of people who support the work of the foundation and the results that have been achieved for people here at home and around the world\\n\\nand i think that we are very clear about where we stand certainly where i stand on all of these issues there cant be any mistake about my passion concerning womens rights here at home and around the world\\n\\nso i think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what were working on\\n\\nclinton hi right here\\n\\nquestion secretary clinton\\n\\nclinton shes sort of squashed so weve got to\\n\\nquestion hi secretary\\n\\nclinton hi\\n\\nquestion i was wondering if you think that you made a mistake either in exclusively using your private email or in response to the controversy around it and if so what have you learned from that\\n\\nclinton well i have to tell you that as i said in my remarks looking back it would have been probably you know smarter to have used two devices but i have absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the state department\\n\\nand i have to add even if i had had two devices which is obviously permitted  many people do that  you would still have to put the responsibility where it belongs which is on the official so i did it for convenience and i now looking back think that it might have been smarter to have those two devices from the very beginning\\n\\nquestion secretary clinton\\n\\nclinton yes question did you or any of your aides delete any government related emails from your personal account and what lengths are you willing to go to to prove that you didnt\\n\\nsome people including supporters of yours have suggested having an independent arbiter look at your server for instance\\n\\nclinton we did not in fact my direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related\\n\\nthat doesnt mean they will be by the state department once the state department goes through them but out of an abundance of caution and care you know we wanted to send that message unequivocally\\n\\nthat is the responsibility of the individual and i have fulfilled that responsibility and i have no doubt that we have done exactly what we should have done when the search was conducted we were asking that any email be identified and preserved that could potentially be federal records and thats exactly what we did\\n\\nand we went as i said beyond that and the process produced over 30000 you know work emails and i think that we have more than met the requests from the state department the server contains personal communications from my husband and me and i believe i have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private and i think that the state department will be able over time to release all of the records that were provided\\n\\nquestion madam secretary can you\\n\\nclinton right there\\n\\nquestion madam secretary two quick follow ups you mentioned the server thats one of the distinctions here\\n\\nthis wasnt gmail or yahoo or something this was a server that you owned is that appropriate is it  was there any precedent for it did you clear it with any state department security officials and do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary\\n\\nand then separately will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president thank you\\n\\nclinton well the system we used was set up for president clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the secret service and there were no security breaches\\n\\nso i think that the  the use of that server which started with my husband certainly proved to be effective and secure now with respect to any sort of future  future issues look i trust the american people to make their decisions about political and public matters and i feel that ive taken unprecedented steps to provide these workrelated emails theyre going to be in the public domain and i think that americans will find that you know interesting and i look forward to having a discussion about that\\n\\nquestion madam secretary\\n\\nclinton hi\\n\\nquestion how could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature that you didnt also delete emails that were professional but possibly unflattering\\n\\nand what do you think about this republican idea of having an independent third party come in an examine your emails\\n\\nclinton well first of all you have to ask that question to every single federal employee because the way the system works the federal employee the individual whether they have one device two devices three devices how many addresses they make the decision\\n\\nso even if you have a workrelated device with a workrelated gov account you choose what goes on that that is the way our system works and so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands maybe millions of people to make those decisions\\n\\nand i feel that i did that and even more that i went above and beyond what i was requested to do and again those will be out in the public domain and people will be able to judge for themselves\\n\\nquestion okay madam\\n\\nmadam secretary\\n\\nmadam secretary excuse me\\n\\nmadam secretary state department rules at the time you were secretary were perfectly clear that if a state department employee was going to be using private email that employee needed to turn those emails over to the state department to be preserved on government computers\\n\\nwhy did you not do that why did you not go along with state department rules until nearly two years after you left office\\n\\nquestion and also the president of the united states said that he was unaware that you had this unusual email arrangement the white house counsels office says that you never approved this arrangement through them\\n\\nwhy did you not do that why did you  why have you apparently caught the white house by surprise\\n\\nand then just one last political question if i  i might does all of this make  affect your decision in any way on whether or not to run for president\\n\\nclinton well let me try to unpack your multiple questions\\n\\nfirst the laws and regulations in effect when i was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work that is undisputed\\n\\nsecondly under the federal records act records are defined as reported information regardless of its form or characteristics and in meeting the record keeping obligations it was my practice to email government officials on their state or other gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved\\n\\nnow there are different rules governing the white house than there are governing the rest of the executive branch and in order to address the requirements i was under i did exactly what i have said i emailed two people and i not only knew i expected that then to be captured in the state department or any other government agency that i was emailing to at a gov account\\n\\nwhat happened in  sorry i guess late summer early  early fall is that the state department sent a letter to former secretaries of state not just to me asking for some assistance in providing any workrelated emails that might be on the personal email\\n\\nand what i did was to direct you know my counsel to conduct a thorough investigation and to err on the side of providing anything that could be connected to work they did that and that was my obligation i fully fulfilled it and then i took the unprecedented step of saying go ahead and release them and let people see them\\n\\nquestion why did you wait two months why  why did you wait two months to turn those emails over the rules say you have to turn them over\\n\\ncrosstalk clinton i dont think  id be happy to have somebody talk to you about the rules i fully complied with every rule that i was governed by\\n\\nquestion were you ever  were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using  using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president\\n\\nclinton i did not email any classified material to anyone on my email there is no classified material\\n\\nso im certainly wellaware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material\\n\\ncrosstalk\\n\\nquestion offmike\\n\\nclinton because they were personal and private about matters that i believed were within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people they have nothing to do with work but i didnt see any reason to keep them\\n\\ncrosstalk\\n\\nquestion at the end of the process\\n\\ncrosstalk\\n\\nquestion  who was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails\\n\\nby the way david shuster from al jazeera america\\n\\nclinton yeah right\\n\\nquestion what about ambassador scott inaudible being forced to resign\\n\\nclinton david i think you should go online and read the entire ig report that is not an accurate representation of what happened\\n\\ncrosstalk\\n\\nclinton thank you thank you thank you all\", \"Text_NoPunctuation\": \"Former secretary of state Hillary

I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private and I think that the State Department will be able over time to release all of the records that were provided\\n\\nQUESTION Madam Secretary can you\\n\\nCLINTON Right there\\n\\nQUESTION Madam Secretary two quick follow ups You mentioned the server Thats one of the distinctions here\\n\\nThis wasnt Gmail or Yahoo or something This was a server that you owned Is that appropriate Is it  was there any precedent for it Did you clear it with any State Department security officials And do they have  did they have full access to it when you were secretary\\n\\nAnd then separately will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president Thank you\\n\\nCLINTON Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office And it had numerous safeguards It was on property guarded by the Secret Service And there were no security breaches\\n\\nSo I think that the  the use of that server which started with my husband certainly proved to be effective and secure Now with respect to any sort of future  future issues look I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters And I feel that Ive taken unprecedented steps to provide these workrelated emails Theyre going to be in the public domain And I think that Americans will find that you know interesting and I look forward to having a discussion about that\\n\\nQUESTION Madam Secretary\\n\\nCLINTON Hi\\n\\nQUESTION How could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature that you didnt also delete emails that were professional but possibly unflattering\\n\\nAnd what do you think about this Republican idea of having an independent third party come in an examine your emails\\n\\nCLINTON Well first of all you have to ask that question to every single federal employee because the way the system works the federal employee the individual whether they have one device two devices three devices how many addresses they make the decision\\n\\nSo even if you have a workrelated device with a workrelated gov account you choose what goes on that That is the way our system works And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands maybe millions of people to make those decisions\\n\\nAnd I feel that I did that and even more that I went above and beyond what I was requested to do And again those will be out in the public domain and people will be able to judge for themselves\\n\\nQUESTION Okay Madam\\n\\nMadam Secretary\\n\\nMadam Secretary excuse me\\n\\nMadam Secretary State Department rules at the time you were secretary were perfectly clear that if a State Department employee was going to be using private email that employee needed to turn those emails over to the State Department to be preserved on government computers\\n\\nWhy did you not do that Why did you not go along with State Department rules until nearly two years after you left office\\n\\nQUESTION And also the president of the United States said that he was unaware that you had this unusual email arrangement The White House counsels office says that you never approved this arrangement through them\\n\\nWhy did you not do that Why did you  why have you apparently caught the White House by surprise\\n\\nAnd then just one last political question if I  I might Does all of this make  affect your decision in any way on whether or not to run for president\\n\\nCLINTON Well let me try to unpack your multiple questions\\n\\nFirst the laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work That is undisputed\\n\\nSecondly under the Federal Records Act records are defined as reported information regardless of its form or characteristics and in meeting the record keeping obligations it was my practice to email government officials on their state or other gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved\\n\\nNow there are different rules governing the White House than there are governing the rest of the executive branch and in order to address the requirements I was under I did exactly what I have said I emailed two people and I not only knew I expected that then to be captured in the State Department or any other government agency that I was emailing to at a gov account\\n\\nWhat happened in  sorry I guess late summer early  early fall is that the State Department sent a letter to former secretaries of state not just to me asking for some assistance in providing any workrelated emails that might be on the personal email\\n\\nAnd what I did was to direct you know my counsel to conduct a thorough investigation and to err on the side of providing anything that could be connected to work They did that and that was my obligation I fully fulfilled it and then I took the unprecedented step of saying Go ahead and release them and let people see them\\n\\nQUESTION Why did you wait two months Why  why did you wait two months to turn those emails over The rules say you have to turn them over\\n\\nCROSSTALK CLINTON I dont think  Id be happy to have somebody talk to you about the rules I fully complied with every rule that I was governed by\\n\\nQUESTION Were you ever  were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using  using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president\\n\\nCLINTON I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email There is no classified material\\n\\nSo Im certainly wellaware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material\\n\\nCROSSTALK\\n\\nQUESTION OFFMIKE\\n\\nCLINTON Because they were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people They have nothing to do with work but I didnt see any reason to keep them\\n\\nCROSSTALK\\n\\nQUESTION At the end of the process\\n\\nCROSSTALK\\n\\nQUESTION  who was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails\\n\\nBy the way David Shuster from Al Jazeera America\\n\\nCLINTON Yeah Right\\n\\nQUESTION What about Ambassador Scott inaudible being forced to resign\\n\\nCLINTON David I think you should go online and read the entire IG report That is not an accurate representation of what happened\\n\\nCROSSTALK\\n\\nCLINTON Thank you Thank you Thank you all\", \"Text_NoStopwords\": \"former secretary state hillary clinton
