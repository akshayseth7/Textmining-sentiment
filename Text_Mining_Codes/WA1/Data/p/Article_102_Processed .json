"{\"Text\": \"The Weeknd has been making critically acclaimed R&B for more than four years now, but hes never had a year like 2015. Ever since scoring his first Top 10 single as a solo artist with Earned It, off the Fifty Shades soundtrack, in February, hes been a fixture at the top of the charts. Earlier this month, he scored his first No. 1, with the Off the Wall-esque Cant Feel My Face, and he currently has two songs in the Top 5 at the same time. The arrival of his new album, Beauty Behind the Madness, next week, seems destined to represent the arrival of a new megastar.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, just in time for the weekend (get it?), the R&B singer-songwriter-producer has shared an extended preview of that new album, in the form of an 18-minute mix, stitching together every song on the album, called The Leak:\", \"Text_Bigrams\":
