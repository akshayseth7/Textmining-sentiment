"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images\\n\\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump took a break from talking about unauthorized immigrants on Sunday to say that he would change the tax code to force people who work at hedge funds to pay more in taxes. The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder, he told CBS News on Sunday. The real estate mogul said that if he were president he would change the tax code to force those who work for hedge funds to pay more.\\n\\nThe hedge fund guys didnt build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky, Trump said. They are energetic. They are very smart. But a lot of themthey are paper-pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. Its ridiculous, ok?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump said his plan to make hedge fund managers pay more tax was part of his effort to save the middle class by lowering their tax rates. I want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one. Theyre getting absolutely destroyed. This country, it wont have a middle class very soon. In criticizing the tax that hedge fund managers pay, Trump was referring to what is known as the carried interest loophole. Reuters explains that it is the provision in the tax code which allows private equity and hedge fund managers pay taxes at the capital gains rate instead of the ordinary income rate. Trump, however, failed to specify how he would reform the tax code and change that provision.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"mark\"], [\"mark\", \"wallheisergetty\"], [\"wallheisergetty\",
