"{\"Text\": \"CBS Broadcasting Inc.\\n\\nIn the Big Book of Quotations for Boorish Dudes, pride of place goes to Woody Allens line that bisexuality immediately doubles your chance of a date on Saturday night.\\n\\nBut on television these days, a bisexual character does seem to double a shows chances of building a fan base. And judging from three series currently featuring strong bisexual women, admitting an attraction to both girls and boys is the hot new signifier of confidence and independence.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Good Wifes Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) was the first in this latest round of bisexual heroines. Strictly speaking, Kalinda doesnt identify as bisexualor accept any other label for that matter: When then-friend and co-worker Alicia Florrick asked if she was gay, she replied, Im private. But shes been shown kissing and enjoying post-coital moments with both men and women.\\n\\nKalindas sexuality is just one aspect of the air of mystery that surrounds her. Over the shows three seasons, weve gleaned a few tidbits about her past, but theres still a lot we dont knowlike her real name, or why a senior partner at the law firm where she works as in-house investigator has been handling a tax case on her behalf.\\n\\nKalinda is one of the most efficient characters on televisionshe single-handedly solves a mystery at the center of the show with remarkable frequencybut she hates to be pigeonholed. The only time I can recall her seeming less than omniscient was when she and then-colleague Cary Agos conducted an investigation in Little India; Cary erroneously assumed that Kalinda speaks Hindi, which left her quite flustered. She isnt a typical American desi, nor is she a typical bisexual.\\n\\nLike Kalinda, Bo, the central character on Lost Girl (played by Anna Silk), hates to pick sides. She grew up believing herself to be a killer kisserliterallyso you can imagine the relief when she learns that she isnt human. Instead, shes a supernatural seductress known as succubus, part of the Fae, who are divided into two clans, light and dark. Bo refuses to align herself with either camp, which leaves her distrusted by both groups.\\n\\nIts fitting, then, that she refuses to stick to just male or female sex partners. As she says in a voiceover during the opening credits, Life is hard when you dont know who you are; harder when you dont know what you are. ... I will live the life I choose. Bo is involved with Dyson, a male Fae who works as a police detective, and Lauren, a female doctor who works for the Fae. They each have something different to offer herDyson can heal her, while Lauren can help learn to calibrate her powers. Their interactions are differentwith Dyson the sex is wild and shrieky, while with Lauren its all sighs and meaningful eye contactbut given their differing physiologies, maybe thats more than just a recitation of cliched ideas about heterosexual and lesbian sex.\\n\\nOn Showtimes House of Lies, meanwhile, being bisexual is mostly about being hot and uninhibited. April (Megalyn Echikunwoke) could be described as the girlfriend of management consultant Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle), but that undersells her. Shes a stripper, a law student, and, we learned in Episode 6, a cop killer.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"cbs\", \"broadcasting\"], [\"broadcasting\", \"inc\"], [\"inc\", \"big\"], [\"big\", \"book\"],
