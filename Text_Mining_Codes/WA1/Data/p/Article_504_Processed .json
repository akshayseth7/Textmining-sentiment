"{\"Text\": \"Photo by PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nOn Monday, a Starbucks executive with the baffling title Director, Espresso and Brewed Coffee Americas, wrote a blog post with the headline, Big News for the Beloved Pumpkin Spice Latte. The big news is that when the Pumpkin Spice Latte returns to Starbucks outlets for a limited time this fall, it will be made with a different recipe. Now, for the first time, the Pumpkin Spice Latte will contain actual pumpkin.\\n\\nL.V. Anderson L.V. Anderson is a Slate associate editor. She edits Slate's food and drink sections and writes Brow Beat's recipe column, Youre Doing It Wrong.\\n\\nThis is a terrible idea for two reasons.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first is that, in making this change, Starbucks is capitulating to a fear-mongering food blogger whom wed all be better off ignoring. Public awareness that Pumpkin Spice Lattes contain no actual pumpkin has been percolating for yearssee, for instance, this 2012 essay by Felix Salmon, which acknowledges that pumpkin dishes dont even need any actual pumpkin in them in order to cash in on the warming, autumnal vibe, or this 2013 video by the New York Times flavor expert Michael Moss, which blows open the industrys biggest secret: there often is little or no actual pumpkin in pumpkin-flavored foods and drinks. For a while, this was just a fun factoid about the dystopian, consumerist, David Foster Wallace-esque world we inhabit, but no one really cared that there was no pumpkin in the PSL. After all, no one orders a sweetened latte under the belief that theyre getting a nourishing serving of vegetables.\\n\\nThen, last year, Vani Hari, a wildly popular blogger known as the Food Babe who gained a following by stoking irrational fears about GMOs and toxins in foods, wrote a blog post about all the ostensible dangers of drinking PSLs, dangers like preservatives and sulfites and non-organic milk. One ingredient singled out by the Food Babe may actually be hazardouscaramel coloring is definitely carcinogenic in mice, which makes some scientists think its carcinogenic in humans, too. (Starbucks announced this week that theyre cutting caramel coloring from the PSL, too.) But most of the Food Babes outrage was misplaced, and her shock that theres no real pumpkin in a PSL would be cute if it werent accompanied by so much nonsense about imaginary risks.\\n\\nSo its disappointing that Starbucks is adding pumpkin to its PSL to appease an influential but misguided kook. But thats not the only reason adding pumpkin to the PSL is a bad idea. Its a bad idea because pumpkinand here Im talking about pumpkin, the unadulterated gourd fleshdoesnt taste good.\\n\\nAs Salmon wrote in 2012, Pumpkin, on its own, is not a very appetizing food at all. He called it dense and stringy; Id add earthy, vegetal, and sometimes bitter. The only reason pumpkin pie tastes delicious is that it has lots of dairy, sugar, and spices in itthe pumpkin is only there for texture, color, and bragging rights. The PSL already has dairy, sugar, and spices in itand thats why its so popular! Its all the flavor of pumpkin pie with none of the bulk. Adding something potentially distasteful to a beloved concoction is only asking for trouble. And if Starbucks has added such a tiny amount of pumpkin puree to its recipe that it doesnt affect the flavor at all, well, thats silly.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"paul\"], [\"paul\", \"j\"],
