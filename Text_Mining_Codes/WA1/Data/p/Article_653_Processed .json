IBM was for Orwellian conformists; Apple was for those who think different. A Mac was a young guy in a hoodie; a PC was John Hodgman in a suit.\\n\\nIn the smartphone era, the landscape has shifted. Googles Android is the worlds most popular mobile operating system. But its Apples iOS that commands the long lines, fat profit margins, and perch atop the cultural zeitgeist. Google has responded by turning some of Apples old underdog marketing tactics against it: Be together, not the same, Android commercials urge.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nHow different are the people who use iPhones, really, from those who use Android devices? Various studies have helped to construct a basic demographic sketch of each: iOS users are reputedly younger, richer, spendier, and even smarter. Android users are, well, the opposite. But none of those metrics tells us much about what the two groups are actually likehow they eat, drink, shop, or play.\\n\\nNew data from Yelp, the popular local-business reviews site, shed fresh light on how users of the two leading mobile operating systems differ in their online behavior. The data, culled from hundreds of millions of Yelp searches on mobile devices over a six-month period, compare the relative popularity of dozens of popular search queries on each platform.* Yelp recently shared the data with Slate, and we decided it would be fun to share it with youbut more fun to quiz you on it first. (Update, Aug. 7, 2015: You can read Yelps own blog post on this data, including its interpretation of some of the results, on the Yelp Engineering Blog.)\\n\\nTest your assumptions in the quiz below, and then read on for some interpretation of the results, including some interesting caveats on the methodology.\\n\\nLoading Quiz ...\\n\\nThe Yelp data, assembled by the companys data science team, is fascinating in a few ways. At first glance it seems to confirm a host of stereotypes about Android and iOS users while curiously defying a few others.\\n\\nYes, iOS users sip wine, gulp Starbucks, and splurge on organics at Whole Foods. Android users get tattoos, and hit the buffet, and are always on the hunt for deals. In fact, deals showed a greater discrepancy in popularity between the two platforms than any other search term Yelp shared with us. It was the 24th-most-popular Android search, but didnt even crack the top 200 on iOS.\\n\\nBut Android users also search more for yoga, which might seem like the sort of upper-middle-class pursuit youd associate with iOSers. They appear to prefer cupcakes to donuts. And if Android users are older than their Jobs-worshipping counterparts, they sure dont party like it. Danceclubs, nightlife, and karaoke all ranked higher on Android.\\n\\nOne nice thing about the Yelp data is that such findings are highly unlikely to be an artifact of a small sample size. Indeed, the sample of all Yelp searches in the U.S. over a six-month period is enormous, revealing differences in behavior too subtle to capture in an ordinary survey.\\n\\nThat doesnt mean there arent other forms of bias at work, though. We talked with Travis Brooks, who heads Yelps data-mining team, about what could be behind some of the behavior differences that arent readily explained by variables like age or class. He told us he doesnt have hard answers for why, say, yoga ranks higher among search queries on Android than it does on iOS. But he does have some hypotheses about how factors other than simple consumer preference might shape users queries.\\n\\nFor one thing, searching for something frequently on Yelp doesnt necessarily equate to partaking in it habitually. Imagine youre a lifelong yogi: You might know your favorite studios so well that you have no need to look up customer reviews of them. A cupcake addict might not need a Yelp search to find his next fix, but he might pull up the app on the occasions when he feels the urge to try donuts instead. Or perhaps iOS users search for donuts on Yelp because theyre hoping online reviews will steer them to the fanciest, trendiest, most artisanal donuts, whereas Android users are content to hit the nearest Dunkin.\\n\\nBut maybe thats trying too hard to make the results mesh with popular preconceptions. After all, one could use the same logic to undermine the more intuitive findings (e.g., perhaps its really Android users who prefer Starbucks and Whole Foods, and thats why they search for them more rarely). At some point the exercise devolves into a Rorschach blotyou interpret what you want to interpret.\\n\\nBrooks also raised a subtler and wonkier point that might help explain some of the data. Users Yelp searches arent shaped only by their own preferences. Theyre also shaped by the design of each platforms software interfacethe user experience, in Silicon Valley lingo. For instance, both Android and iOS have autocomplete features that attempt to guess the words their users are trying to type. Those features rely on different algorithms, so typing the same few letters might yield different autocomplete terms on each operating system. The Yelp interface is also slightly different on each platform, perhaps encouraging users to type in full search terms on one while browsing preset categories on the other. Brooks told us that iOS users are more than twice as likely to include apostrophes in business names.\\n\\nBrooks couldnt say for sure what software quirks or demographic differences might explain which results in the data Yelp provided. Anecdotally, however, we found one relatively consistent discrepancy between the terms most popular with Android users and those ranked highest on iOS. The top-ranked Android searches were more likely to be generic terms like deals, parks, or beer and wine, while the top-ranked iOS searches were more often name brands like Target, Chipotle, or Sephora. That would seem to imply that iPhone users are more brand-conscious than those who opt for Android devices. But then, perhaps thats the one thing we already knew for sure.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"illustration\"], [\"illustration\", \"juliana\"], [\"juliana\", \"jimenez\"], [\"jimenez\",

for those who think different A Mac was a young guy in a hoodie a PC was John Hodgman in a suit\\n\\nIn the smartphone era the landscape has shifted Googles Android is the worlds most popular mobile operating system But its Apples iOS that commands the long lines fat profit margins and perch atop the cultural zeitgeist Google has responded by turning some of Apples old underdog marketing tactics against it Be together not the same Android commercials urge\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nHow different are the people who use iPhones really from those who use Android devices Various studies have helped to construct a basic demographic sketch of each iOS users are reputedly younger richer spendier and even smarter Android users are well the opposite But none of those metrics tells us much about what the two groups are actually likehow they eat drink shop or play\\n\\nNew data from Yelp the popular localbusiness reviews site shed fresh light on how users of the two leading mobile operating systems differ in their online behavior The data culled from hundreds of millions of Yelp searches on mobile devices over a sixmonth period compare the relative popularity of dozens of popular search queries on each platform Yelp recently shared the data with Slate and we decided it would be fun to share it with youbut more fun to quiz you on it first Update Aug 7 2015 You can read Yelps own blog post on this data including its interpretation of some of the results on the Yelp Engineering Blog\\n\\nTest your assumptions in the quiz below and then read on for some interpretation of the results including some interesting caveats on the methodology\\n\\nLoading Quiz \\n\\nThe Yelp data assembled by the companys data science team is fascinating in a few ways At first glance it seems to confirm a host of stereotypes about Android and iOS users while curiously defying a few others\\n\\nYes iOS users sip wine gulp Starbucks and splurge on organics at Whole Foods Android users get tattoos and hit the buffet and are always on the hunt for deals In fact deals showed a greater discrepancy in popularity between the two platforms than any other search term Yelp shared with us It was the 24thmostpopular Android search but didnt even crack the top 200 on iOS\\n\\nBut Android users also search more for yoga which might seem like the sort of uppermiddleclass pursuit youd associate with iOSers They appear to prefer cupcakes to donuts And if Android users are older than their Jobsworshipping counterparts they sure dont party like it Danceclubs nightlife and karaoke all ranked higher on Android\\n\\nOne nice thing about the Yelp data is that such findings are highly unlikely to be an artifact of a small sample size Indeed the sample of all Yelp searches in the US over a sixmonth period is enormous revealing differences in behavior too subtle to capture in an ordinary survey\\n\\nThat doesnt mean there arent other forms of bias at work though We talked with
