"{\"Text\": \"Again, a casual viewer of That Sugar Filmor even an incurious film criticmight not realize that Campbell has little expertise in nutritional epidemiology, physiology, or the psychology of eating. A casual viewer or incurious film critic also wouldnt realize that Campbell isnt even qualified as a physicist. Contrary to his on-screen credentialing, it seems he never finished his Ph.D., and his supposed stint at NASA is poorly documented, too. (Campbells acolytes explain that he spent years doing classified, high-level work on missile defense , and that hes not allowed to talk about the details.)\\n\\nWho is Tom Campbell, really? Another New Age guru, and author of three quasi-philosophical books about the nature of consciousness, which purport to derive a new,  more fundamental science that directly answers the most pressing problems and paradoxes of modern physics . According to Campbells quantum-flavored Theory of Everything, nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, preservatives, and sugar are all mind-altering drugs that prevent people from achieving their higher reality. (I have that from a 2010 video, available on YouTube, titled  The Affect [sic] of Sugar on Consciousness. )\\n\\nWolfe gets plenty of screen timefar more than anyone who might reasonably be described as a scientist. So does Tom Campbell, a soft-spoken, bearded figure whom Gameau helpfully identifies as a former NASA physicist, as if that would qualify him to opine on the health effect of sugar. Needless to say, Campbell has lots of opinions. Theyre fuzzy, he says of people who eat a lot of sugar. Their minds are cloudy all the time.\\n\\nCasual viewers of the film wont know that DesMaisons ideas might be somewhat less reliable than Popkins, since her credentials are presented as being on a par with his . Same goes for another putative expert in the film, the floppy-haired nutrition guru David Wolfe. A self-described Health, Eco, Nutrition and Natural Beauty Expert and  one of the worlds top authorities on chocolate and organic superfoods , Wolfe spends his days touting the spiritual and health benefits of such things as deer antler spray (a levitational, androgenic force), baby-reflexology, and  earthing  (in which people plug themselves into the ground wire of an electrical outlet so as to naturally discharge electrical stress from our bodies). Seen outside the context of That Sugar Film, the man appears to be a lunatic.\\n\\nIts very hard for us to know, for example, that Gameaus panel of expertswho take us through the science and explicate the dataincludes a supergroup of charlatans and cranks. The movie does offer snatches of dialogue from a few legitimate scientists, such as the respected public health researcher Barry Popkin . But these are couched amid disquisitions from members of the sugar-fearing fringe. One major figure in the film is Kathleen DesMaisons , author of Potatoes Not Prozac , an evangelist for the poorly substantiated notion of sugar sensitivity. DesMaisons is the president of Radiant Recovery, an Albuquerque-based program that makes sugar reduction a centerpiece of drug rehab . Her credentials include a Ph.D. in the made-up discipline of addictive nutrition, received from an obscure, distance-learning university .\\n\\nWhats most remarkable about the film is the way it passes off these radical ideasmost without any evidenceas common sense if not scientific dogma. To make his theories palatable, Gameau puts a pinch of data into the blender, and mixes up a thick and creamy anecdote spiced with speculation. That mixture goes down nice and easy: Critics say the movie is entertaining and informative , and full of disturbing and inconvenient truths about the way we live. But That Sugar Film is so highly processed, and so laden with chintzy, artificial arguments, that its many weaknesses are hidden from consumers.\\n\\nOld news, right? But Gameau is not content to claim that added sugar makes us fat and lazy and unwell. He also proposes that dietary sugar causes mental fogginess; that it leads to bipolar disorder; that it makes children fail at school; that it has produced a dental health emergency in Appalachia; that it may soon drive Australian Aborigines extinct; and, indeed, that it could be the source of runaway consumer capitalism. If sugar isnt evil, then its at least nefarious, malevolent, and wicked; or heinous and corrupt; or perfidious and wrong.\\n\\nIn the mold of Super Size Me , Gameau makes himself the guinea pig. As part of the gimmick, he restricts his diet to packaged foods that may not seem so junky at first glance: granola bars, breakfast drinks, something called fruit bites, and so on. (These contain enough sugar, in aggregate, to reach a 40-teaspoon daily dose.) You can imagine the results: Gameaus binge leaves his brain and body in a shambles. He puts on 19 pounds, and adds 4 inches to his waist. His skin breaks out in pimples. He grows moody and lethargic. But the turning point , he says, came just 18 days into the project, by which point hed developed fatty liver disease . Sugar isnt evil, the film concludes, but life is so much better when you get rid of it.\\n\\nOne of the most popular family films in America right now, if you go by digital sales, is an Australian documentary about sugar. Made by actor Damon Gameau, That Sugar Film tells the story of a two-monthlong experiment in self-destructive eating: What happens when a person eats 40 teaspoons of sugar every day?\\n\\nThe film promotes Campbells claim that sugar makes us dumb, moody, and ineffective. In one scene, Gameau, on his high-sugar diet, goes to his nutritionist and announces that he feels hungover every day, and that his moods have gotten unpredictable. She draws a sine wave on a piece of paper by way of explanation: The sugar in his diet has sent him on a roller coaster of insulin and adrenalin, she says; its a mind-altering back-and-forth that can even lead to panic attacks and symptoms of bipolar disorder. Gameau nods his head. That sounds about right!\\n\\nYeah, well, theres some science to suggest that sugar affects behavior and cognition in rodents, but less support for Gameaus theory of carbohydrate grumpiness. In one set of studies, conducted in Scotland, researchers had several dozen women consume four servings of a bright-orange, bubblegum-flavored soft drink called Irn-Bru every day for a month. Half the women got a sugar-sweetened version, and the other half drank an artificially sweetened version. Each subject kept a diary, and four times per day marked down the degree to which she was feeling sad, angry, anxious, or restless. The extra sugar appeared to have no effect on the womens moods. (For the record, Gameau takes on faith that artificial sweeteners are evil, too.)\\n\\nStill, the idea that sugar makes us hyperactive, and then lethargic, has been around for decades, and its popularity shows no signs of letting up. The theory spread in the 1970s and 1980s, when large-scale surveys showed an association between childrens sugar intake and behavior problems. It seemed as though high-carb diets were making kids fidgety and aggressive. But in the end, the science went the other way. A 1995 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with placebos failed to find a causal link. We came as close to proving the null hypothesis as you can, that papers lead author, Mark Wolraich, told me earlier this year. The evidence was so definitive that it became really hard to justify doing more studies.\\n\\nYet Gameau blames sugar for his own mood swings, and then for whatever problems that sugar-munching children might have in school. After all, he has his own experimentunblinded with an N of 1as the proof. The same evidencehis own movieis enough to convince him that sugar causes acne, since he develops zits midway through his sugar binge. Thats not impossible, as some dermatologists now believe that high-glycemic diets lead to pimples. But the evidence also suggests that dairy is at least as harmful to our skin, and so is saturated fat. Gameau recommends a paleo-type diet in the film, with minimal sugar but lots of fatbacon, eggs, avocados, nuts, and cheese. In other words, a picnic basket of acne-causing foods.\\n\\nThe projects most disturbing finding, that Gameau developed fatty liver disease in only 18 days, has been emphasized in the films reviews. But it strikes me as a gross exaggeration. The claim is based on something called an ALT test, which looks for levels of a liver enzyme in the blood. Gameaus went from a baseline score of 20 up to 60 at the next readingenough of an uptick for his doctor to declare his liver damaged. But your ALT score doesnt tell you the status of your liver; it only hints that you might be at higher risk of having problems. And the ALT test is known to be somewhat unreliable, going up and down depending on your level of exercise, whether youve been taking Tylenol, and several other factors. One study even found that 30 percent of patients with elevated ALT scores turned out to be in the normal range when they were retested two weeks later.\\n\\nTheres so much more to question in the movie. Gameau uses 40 teaspoons of sugar as his daily baseline for comparisonhe claims this level of consumption is normal in Australiabut the most recent data show that Americans, at least, consume less than half that total every day, an average of just 18 teaspoons. Gameau also treats it as a given that among the sugars that we eat, fructose is uniquely bad for health. In this, hes following the line of Gary Taubes, a journalist who has made this argument for years, and who appears throughout the film. But Taubes understands that his case has not been proved. Thats why hes spent so much time raising tens of millions of dollars for a series of laboratory studies that might give us better answers. (Ferris Jabr of Scientific American has a great review of fructose science, and a few of its outstanding questions.)\\n\\nIn other words, That Sugar Film takes an outsider, even contrarian, view in the study of nutrition, and makes it out to be a well-established science. Then it corroborates that view with a silly self-experiment, and tosses in alarmist claims for added flavor. Yet weve reached such a nadir in our understanding of nutritionand the anti-sugar fervor has gotten so intensethat this blather can come off not merely as informative and entertaining, as the critics called it, but even as remedial. We knew all this already, some critics griped, as if the movies crazy notions were established science. [T]he truths That Sugar Film contains were already obvious decades ago. Its sad that we need reminding, wrote a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Many of Gameaus findings wont come as earth-shattering revelations, said the Los Angeles Times. [T]heres really nothing fresh in terms of news or science, complained the Toronto Star.\\n\\nIsnt it the job of these reviewers to appraise the message of a scientific film in scientific terms? Why cant they try to test its claims against the facts? That Sugar Film, like other issues-oriented docs, would seem to merit something other than a standard film reviewone based on expertise rather than aesthetics. Yet movie critics never seem to broaden out their brief. Instead they treat propaganda as a form of self-expression, rated for its rhetoric. How entertaining is the film, and how persuasive? These are measures of a movies craft, not of its truth.\\n\\nAs a result, simple-minded and suspicious notions run rampant through the movie pages of the newspaper. In 2011, another Australian, Joe Cross, put out the documentary Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead, about a 60-day green-juice fast that helped him trim 90 pounds and wean off medication for his autoimmune disease. That documentary shows him under the medical care of Dr. Joel Fuhrman, a nutrition guru who promotes vacuous but impressive-sounding health equations as a means of bettering ones life. Yet the critics never grappled with the movies science. (A few noted that the movie sounded like an infomercial, but these were gripes about its form more than its content.) [The movies] now-healthy heart is in the right place, wrote one reviewer in the New York Times, as if to sidestep any judgment from his brain. Do juice fasts really work?

\"again a casual viewer of that sugar filmor even an incurious film criticmight not realize that campbell has little expertise in nutritional epidemiology physiology or the psychology of eating a casual viewer or incurious film critic also wouldnt realize that campbell isnt even qualified as a physicist contrary to his onscreen credentialing it seems he never finished his phd and his supposed stint at nasa is poorly documented too campbells acolytes explain that he spent years doing classified highlevel work on missile defense  and that hes not allowed to talk about the details\\n\\nwho is tom campbell really another new age guru and author of three quasiphilosophical books about the nature of consciousness which purport to derive a new  more fundamental science that directly answers the most pressing problems and paradoxes of modern physics  according to campbells quantumflavored theory of everything nicotine alcohol caffeine preservatives and sugar are all mindaltering drugs that prevent people from achieving their higher reality i have that from a 2010 video available on youtube titled  the affect sic of sugar on consciousness \\n\\nwolfe gets plenty of screen timefar more than anyone who might reasonably be described as a scientist so does tom campbell a softspoken bearded figure whom gameau helpfully identifies as a former nasa physicist as if that would qualify him to opine on the health effect of sugar needless to say campbell has lots of opinions theyre fuzzy he says of people who eat a lot of sugar their minds are cloudy all the time\\n\\ncasual viewers of the film wont know that desmaisons ideas might be somewhat less reliable than popkins since her credentials are presented as being on a par with his  same goes for another putative expert in the film the floppyhaired nutrition guru david wolfe a selfdescribed health eco nutrition and natural beauty expert and  one of the worlds top authorities on chocolate and organic superfoods  wolfe spends his days touting the spiritual and health benefits of such things as deer antler spray a levitational androgenic force babyreflexology and  earthing  in which people plug themselves into the ground wire of an electrical outlet so as to naturally discharge electrical stress from our bodies seen outside the context of that sugar film the man appears to be a lunatic\\n\\nits very hard for us to know for example that gameaus panel of expertswho take us through the science and explicate the dataincludes a supergroup of charlatans and cranks the movie does offer snatches of dialogue from a few legitimate scientists such as the respected public health researcher barry popkin  but these are couched amid disquisitions from members of the sugarfearing fringe one major figure in the film is kathleen desmaisons  author of potatoes not prozac  an evangelist for the poorly substantiated notion of sugar sensitivity desmaisons is the president of radiant recovery an albuquerquebased program that makes sugar reduction a centerpiece of drug rehab  her credentials include a phd in the madeup discipline of addictive nutrition received from an obscure distancelearning university \\n\\nwhats most remarkable about the film is the way it passes off these radical ideasmost without any evidenceas common sense if not scientific dogma to make his theories palatable gameau puts a pinch of data into the blender and mixes up a thick and creamy anecdote spiced with speculation that mixture goes down nice and easy critics say the movie is entertaining and informative  and full of disturbing and inconvenient truths about the way we live but that sugar film is so highly processed and so laden with chintzy artificial arguments that its many weaknesses are hidden from consumers\\n\\nold news right but gameau is not content to claim that added sugar makes us fat and lazy and unwell he also proposes that dietary sugar causes mental fogginess that it leads to bipolar disorder that it makes children fail at school that it has produced a dental health emergency in appalachia that it may soon drive australian aborigines extinct and indeed that it could be the source of runaway consumer capitalism if sugar isnt evil then its at least nefarious malevolent and wicked or heinous and corrupt or perfidious and wrong\\n\\nin the mold of super size me  gameau makes himself the guinea pig as part of the gimmick he restricts his diet to packaged foods that may not seem so junky at first glance granola bars breakfast drinks something called fruit bites and so on these contain enough sugar in aggregate to reach a 40teaspoon daily dose you can imagine the results gameaus binge leaves his brain and body in a shambles he puts on 19 pounds and adds 4 inches to his waist his skin breaks out in pimples he grows moody and lethargic but the turning point  he says came just 18 days into the project by which point hed developed fatty liver disease  sugar isnt evil the film concludes but life is so much better when you get rid of it\\n\\none of the most popular family films in america right now if you go by digital sales is an australian documentary about sugar made by actor damon gameau that sugar film tells the story of a twomonthlong experiment in selfdestructive eating what happens when a person eats 40 teaspoons of sugar every day\\n\\nthe film promotes campbells claim that sugar makes us dumb moody and ineffective in one scene gameau on his highsugar diet goes to his nutritionist and announces that he feels hungover every day and that his moods have gotten unpredictable she draws a sine wave on a piece of paper by way of explanation the sugar in his diet has sent him on a roller coaster of insulin and adrenalin she says its a mindaltering backandforth that can even lead to panic attacks and symptoms of bipolar disorder gameau nods his head that sounds about right\\n\\nyeah well theres some science to suggest that sugar affects behavior and cognition in rodents but less support for gameaus theory of carbohydrate grumpiness in one set of studies conducted in scotland researchers had several dozen women consume four servings of a brightorange bubblegumflavored soft drink called irnbru every day for a month half the women got a sugarsweetened version and the other half drank an artificially sweetened version each subject kept a diary and four times per day marked down the degree to which she was feeling sad angry anxious or restless the extra sugar appeared to have no effect on the womens moods for the record gameau takes on faith that artificial sweeteners are evil too\\n\\nstill the idea that sugar makes us hyperactive and then lethargic has been around for decades and its popularity shows no signs of letting up the theory spread in the 1970s and 1980s when largescale surveys showed an association between childrens sugar intake and behavior problems it seemed as though highcarb diets were making kids fidgety and aggressive but in the end the science went the other way a 1995 metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials with placebos failed to find a causal link we came as close to proving the null hypothesis as you can that papers lead author mark wolraich told me earlier this year the evidence was so definitive that it became really hard to justify doing more studies\\n\\nyet gameau blames sugar for his own mood swings and then for whatever problems that sugarmunching children might have in school after all he has his own experimentunblinded with an n of 1as the proof the same evidencehis own movieis enough to convince him that sugar causes acne since he develops zits midway through his sugar binge thats not impossible as some dermatologists now believe that highglycemic diets lead to pimples but the evidence also suggests that dairy is at least as harmful to our skin and so is saturated fat gameau recommends a paleotype diet in the film with minimal sugar but lots of fatbacon eggs avocados nuts and cheese in other words a picnic basket of acnecausing foods\\n\\nthe projects most disturbing finding that gameau developed fatty liver disease in only 18 days has been emphasized in the films reviews but it strikes me as a gross exaggeration the claim is based on something called an alt test which looks for levels of a liver enzyme in the blood gameaus went from a baseline score of 20 up to 60 at the next readingenough of an uptick for his doctor to declare his liver damaged but your alt score doesnt tell you the status of your liver it only hints that you might be at higher risk of having problems and the alt test is known to be somewhat unreliable going up and down depending on your level of exercise whether youve been taking tylenol and several other factors one study even found that 30 percent of patients with elevated alt scores turned out to be in the normal range when they were retested two weeks later\\n\\ntheres so much more to question in the movie gameau uses 40 teaspoons of sugar as his daily baseline for comparisonhe claims this level of consumption is normal in australiabut the most recent data show that americans at least consume less than half that total every day an average of just 18 teaspoons gameau also treats it as a given that among the sugars that we eat fructose is uniquely bad for health in this hes following the line of gary taubes a journalist who has made this argument for years and who appears throughout the film but taubes understands that his case has not been proved thats why hes spent so much time raising tens of millions of dollars for a

sugar film takes an outsider even contrarian view in the study of nutrition and makes it out to be a wellestablished science then it corroborates that view with a silly selfexperiment and tosses in alarmist claims for added flavor yet weve reached such a nadir in our understanding of nutritionand the antisugar fervor has gotten so intensethat this blather can come off not merely as informative

noted that the movie sounded like an infomercial but these were gripes about its form more than its content the movies nowhealthy heart is in the right place wrote one reviewer in the new york times as if to sidestep any judgment from his brain do juice fasts really work who knows\", \"Text_NoPunctuation\": \"Again a casual viewer of That Sugar Filmor even an incurious film criticmight not realize that Campbell has little expertise in nutritional epidemiology physiology or the psychology of eating A casual viewer or incurious film critic also wouldnt realize that Campbell isnt even qualified as a physicist Contrary to his onscreen credentialing it seems he never finished his PhD and his supposed stint at NASA is poorly documented too Campbells acolytes explain that he spent years doing classified highlevel work on missile defense  and that hes not allowed to talk about the details\\n\\nWho is Tom Campbell really Another New Age guru and author of three quasiphilosophical books about the nature of consciousness which purport to derive a new  more fundamental science that directly answers the most pressing problems and paradoxes of modern physics  According to Campbells quantumflavored Theory of Everything nicotine alcohol caffeine preservatives and sugar are all mindaltering drugs that prevent people from achieving their higher reality I have that from a 2010 video available on YouTube titled  The Affect sic of Sugar on Consciousness \\n\\nWolfe gets plenty of screen timefar more than anyone who might reasonably be described as a scientist So does Tom Campbell a softspoken bearded figure whom Gameau helpfully identifies as a former NASA physicist as if that would qualify him to opine on the health effect of sugar Needless to say Campbell has lots of opinions Theyre fuzzy he says of people who eat a lot of sugar Their minds are cloudy all the time\\n\\nCasual viewers of the film wont know that DesMaisons ideas might be somewhat less reliable than Popkins since her credentials are presented as being on a par with his  Same goes for another putative expert in the film the floppyhaired nutrition guru David Wolfe A selfdescribed Health Eco Nutrition and Natural Beauty Expert and  one of the worlds top authorities on chocolate and organic superfoods  Wolfe spends his days touting the spiritual and health benefits of such things as deer antler spray a levitational androgenic force babyreflexology and  earthing  in which people plug themselves into the ground wire of an electrical outlet so as to naturally discharge electrical stress from our bodies Seen outside the context of That Sugar Film the man appears to be a lunatic\\n\\nIts very hard for us to know for example that Gameaus panel of expertswho take us through the science and explicate the dataincludes a supergroup of charlatans and cranks The movie does offer snatches of dialogue from a few legitimate scientists such as the respected public health researcher Barry Popkin  But these are couched amid disquisitions from members of the sugarfearing fringe One major figure in the film is Kathleen DesMaisons  author of Potatoes Not Prozac  an evangelist for the poorly substantiated notion of sugar sensitivity DesMaisons is the president of Radiant Recovery an Albuquerquebased program that makes sugar reduction a centerpiece of drug rehab  Her credentials include a PhD in the madeup discipline of addictive nutrition received from an obscure distancelearning university \\n\\nWhats most remarkable about the film is the way it passes off these radical ideasmost without any evidenceas common sense if not scientific dogma To make his theories palatable Gameau puts a pinch of data into the blender and mixes up a thick and creamy anecdote spiced with speculation That mixture goes down nice and easy Critics say the movie is entertaining and informative  and full of disturbing and inconvenient truths about the way we live But That Sugar Film is so highly processed and so laden with chintzy artificial arguments that its many weaknesses are hidden from consumers\\n\\nOld news right But Gameau is not content to claim that added sugar makes us fat and lazy and unwell He also proposes that dietary sugar causes mental fogginess that it leads to bipolar disorder that it makes children fail at school that it has produced a dental health emergency in Appalachia that it may soon drive Australian Aborigines extinct and indeed that it could be the source of runaway consumer capitalism If sugar isnt evil then its at least nefarious malevolent and wicked or heinous and corrupt or perfidious and wrong\\n\\nIn the mold of Super Size Me  Gameau makes himself the guinea pig As part of the gimmick he restricts his diet to packaged foods that may not seem so junky at first glance granola bars breakfast drinks something called fruit bites and so on These contain enough sugar in aggregate to reach a 40teaspoon daily dose You can imagine the results Gameaus binge leaves his brain and body in a shambles He puts on 19 pounds and adds 4 inches to his waist His skin breaks out in pimples He grows moody and lethargic But the turning point  he says came just 18 days into the project by which point hed developed fatty liver disease  Sugar isnt evil the film concludes but life is so much better when you get rid of it\\n\\nOne of the most popular family films in America right now if you go by digital sales is an Australian documentary about sugar Made by actor Damon Gameau That Sugar Film tells the story of a twomonthlong experiment in selfdestructive eating What happens when a person eats 40 teaspoons of sugar every day\\n\\nThe film promotes Campbells claim that sugar makes us dumb moody and ineffective In one scene Gameau on his highsugar diet goes to his nutritionist and announces that he feels hungover every day and that his moods have gotten unpredictable She draws a sine wave on a piece of paper by way of explanation The sugar in his diet has sent him on a roller coaster of insulin and adrenalin she says its a mindaltering backandforth that can even lead to panic attacks and symptoms of bipolar disorder Gameau nods his head That sounds about right\\n\\nYeah well theres some science to suggest that sugar affects behavior and cognition in rodents but less support for Gameaus theory of carbohydrate grumpiness In one set of studies conducted in Scotland researchers had several dozen women consume four servings of a brightorange bubblegumflavored soft drink called IrnBru every day for a month Half the women got a sugarsweetened version and the other half drank an artificially sweetened version Each subject kept a diary and four times per day marked down the degree to which she was feeling sad angry anxious or restless The extra sugar appeared to have no effect on the womens moods For the record Gameau takes on faith that artificial sweeteners are evil too\\n\\nStill the idea that sugar makes us hyperactive and then lethargic has been around for decades and its popularity shows no signs of letting up The theory spread in the 1970s and 1980s when largescale surveys showed an association between childrens sugar intake and behavior problems It seemed as though highcarb diets were making kids fidgety and aggressive But in the end the science went the other way A 1995 metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials with placebos failed to find a causal link We came as close to proving the null hypothesis as you can that papers lead author Mark Wolraich told me earlier this year The evidence was so definitive that it became really hard to justify doing more studies\\n\\nYet Gameau blames sugar for his own mood swings and then for whatever problems that sugarmunching children
