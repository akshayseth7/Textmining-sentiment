"{\"Text\": \"Photo courtesy of ITV/Brown Eyed Boy Limited 2013\\n\\nGary Janettis writing career includes stints at Will & Grace and Family Guy, an unusual preparation for creating a classic British sitcom. Nevertheless, Vicious, which premieres on PBS on Sunday, is just that. It stars Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi as a gay couple in their 70s who have been together for nearly 50 years. Their social routinewhich largely consists of barbed interactions with their old friends Violet, Mason, and Penelopeis interrupted when Ash, a new upstairs neighbor played by Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones Ramsay Snow), knocks on their door.\\n\\nSlate spoke with Janetti about working with some of Britains finest actors, the U.K. presss reaction to the show, and femme-phobia.\\n\\nHow did an American writer come to make such a British show?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Ravenhill, the British playwright, had an idea for doing a show about two elderly gay men, but he was unable to do it because of his commitments at the RSC. I liked the idea of Ian McKellen and Derek Jacob as a gay couple that had been together for 50 years, so I created the world from that starting place. We got commissioned by [British network] ITV, and we took it from there.\\n\\nHow much involvement did McKellen and Jacobi have in shaping the show?\\n\\nIn the very earliest stages, we talked a lot about these men and whats really going on underneath. It always had to be a real truth and a real love underneath, a real history. It had to be rooted in something so they could be horrible to each other and behave in this way. We talked about the 50 years they spent together. How they met. What their flat is like. What their relationship is like with their friends. Nothing in it wasnt very thought-out. Then once everybody was very clear on the universe, they were willing to just go with it.\\n\\nThis is a very gay show, not only because of the subject matter, but the astonishing assemblage of out gay talentyou, Mark Ravenhill, the stars, you even have Jimmy Somerville singing the theme tune.\\n\\nIt is, and in the U.K. its on ITV, which is a very mainstream network. Theyd never done a gay show before. I dont think theres ever been a U.K. sitcom with gay leads, certainly that were a romantic couple.\\n\\nAnd yet some U.K. criticsmostly straight criticssaid that it trafficked in outdated stereotypes. How did you respond to that?\\n\\nIt was a little troubling, to be honest. All the initial reviews of the show were extraordinarily positive and wonderful, then once the show premiered, there was a bit of a backlash. Its a complicated issue, but I find it very interesting that a lot of the straight press called it so stereotypical, as if theyd been our champions for so long and are so worried about safeguarding how were represented, which we know isnt the case. I believe that its a way to be able to dismiss something in a way that you can get away with. Clearly, there are stereotypes about being gay that are funny, that we celebratein comedy, thats what you do. But where else has there been a show where you see a couple that love each other, that have been together for 50 years, that are out gay men, played by two out gay men.\\n\\nThese wouldve been pioneersthat means that theyve been out and never lived a lie since the mid-60s. Thats extraordinary. It was very easy to dismiss them as stereotypes, and say its camp, as if that has a negative connotation. This is part of our history. And also theyre very smart, wicked, loving men.\\n\\nThere was another criticism: that Derek Jacobis character isnt out to his mother. Well, the joke is that hes in his 70s, his mother is in her 90s. The joke is that his mothers still alive, and hes been dealing with this for 48 years. People of their generation didnt come out, so it becomes a very touching thing. If I was writing a show about a 30-year-old man or woman, I would never make that the subject, because its been done to death, and weve moved past that.\\n\\nWhen youre dealing with gay shows, there are so few of them, and people place so many expectations of what they need it to be. And the fact that this had a little bit of subversiveness to it and was a little bit politically incorrect, and it was featuring Ian and Derek, it had to bear extra weight.\\n\\nPerhaps more unusual than a show about gay people is to have a show about old people.\\n\\nThats exactly what I felt, too. There are six characters in the show, and five of them are in their late 60s or 70s. That never happens. And theyre vital. Theyre not the sidebar to somebody else. Theyre not the adjunct. The young man is the one whos trying to be in their world.\\n\\nSo those accusations about dated stereotypes might reflect people not knowing older gay men.\\n\\nI cant say that I would have had the courage to come out in the way they would have had to do. What they had to deal with in the 60s is why I can be where I am now. Its so easy to say the men of that generation are too camp. What men of that generation had to go through when they were in their 20s, to swim against the tide, to not get married, to not pretend you have a girlfriend. Being gay was against the law; you could have gone to jail. These arent things we discuss, because its a sitcom, but its implicit.\\n\\nI was very interested in the character of Violet, played by Frances de la Tour, again one of the great actors of her generation. Shes playing a role thats very similar to her character on the British sitcom Rising Damp from the 1970s; there are almost predatory elements in the way she comes on to Iwan Rheons character, Ash. Tell me how you see Violet.\\n\\nWhat I love about Violet is that this is a woman whos in her 60s, whos never been married, who doesnt have children, whos worked for herself, and whos lived her own life. Shes teasing Ash because she can, and shes getting a rise out of him. Shes enjoying herself. The way Frances does it, theres a wink to what shes doing. Its on a line, but the intention is never for it to be anything lurid. Shes playing with him and shes having fun with her sexuality. Shes happy. Shes indefatigable. She has had horrific relationships, but shes positive about them all. I told Frances that Violet would never use a negative word. She never says somethings terrible. She says, Well, it wasnt wonderful. We dont see women like these celebrated. Theres a certain negativity to the boys, especially Freddie, who looks at everything through a very negative prism. But everything is an opportunity, an adventure, to her.\\n\\nEven in these enlightened times, people still seem to have a problem with effeminate or camp gay characters. Its OK to be butch, but a character whos a bit queeny isnt so well-received. It was the same with Jack on Will & Grace.\\n\\nYes, it did happen on Will & Grace. There had never been a show that was a mainstream hit before that was told from the point of view of gay men. Jack was a three-dimensional, specific characterthere was something very weird and layered and unusual. And there were elements in there that I have. We grew up having to tamp down certain things. I spent so many years when I couldnt gesture too much because of how it seemed, having to conform. So, yes, there are some camp elements to them, but theres no mincing, theres a dignity.\\n\\nWe need to respect the mincing. Its part of our culture!\\n\\nAlso, its funny! When youre doing a comedy, you want to make it funny.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"courtesy\"], [\"courtesy\", \"itvbrown\"], [\"itvbrown\", \"eyed\"], [\"eyed\", \"boy\"], [\"boy\",

have in shaping the show\\n\\nin the very earliest stages we talked a lot about these men and whats really going on underneath it always had to be a real truth and a real love underneath a real

in a way that you can get away with clearly there are stereotypes about being gay that are funny that we celebratein comedy thats what you do but where else has there been a show where you see a

wicked loving men\\n\\nthere was another criticism that derek jacobis character isnt out to his mother well the joke is that hes in his 70s his mother is in her 90s the joke is that his mothers still alive and hes been dealing with this for 48 years people of their generation didnt come out so it becomes a very touching thing if i was writing a show about a 30yearold man or woman i would never

of violet played by frances de la tour again one of the great actors of her generation shes playing a role thats very similar to her character on the british sitcom rising damp from the 1970s there

theres a wink to what shes doing its on a line but the intention is never for it to be anything lurid shes playing with him and shes having fun with her sexuality shes happy shes indefatigable she has had horrific relationships but shes positive about them all i told frances that violet would never use a negative word she never says somethings terrible she says well it wasnt wonderful we dont see

to be rooted in something so they could be horrible to each other and behave in this way We talked about the 50 years they spent together How they met What their flat is like What their relationship is like with their friends Nothing in it wasnt very thoughtout Then once everybody was very clear on the universe they were willing to just go with it\\n\\nThis is a very gay show not only because of the subject matter but the astonishing assemblage of out gay talentyou Mark Ravenhill the stars you even have Jimmy Somerville singing the theme tune\\n\\nIt is and in the UK its on ITV which is a very mainstream network Theyd never done a gay show before I dont think theres ever been a UK sitcom with gay leads certainly that were a romantic couple\\n\\nAnd yet some UK criticsmostly straight criticssaid that it trafficked in outdated stereotypes How did you respond to that\\n\\nIt was a little troubling to be honest All the initial reviews of the show were extraordinarily positive and

our champions for so long and are so worried about safeguarding how were represented which we know isnt the case I believe that its a way to be able to dismiss something in a way that you can get away with Clearly there are stereotypes about being gay that are funny that we celebratein comedy thats what you do But where else has there been a show where you see a couple that love each other that have been together for 50 years that are out gay men played by two out gay men\\n\\nThese wouldve been pioneersthat means that theyve been out and never lived a lie since the mid60s Thats extraordinary It was very easy to dismiss them as stereotypes and say its camp as if that has a negative connotation This is part of our history And also theyre very smart wicked loving men\\n\\nThere was another criticism that Derek Jacobis character isnt out to his mother Well the joke is that hes in his 70s his mother is in her 90s The joke is that his mothers still alive and hes been dealing with this for 48 years People of their generation didnt come out so it becomes a very touching thing If I was writing a show about a 30yearold man or woman I would never make that the subject because its been done to death and weve moved past that\\n\\nWhen youre dealing with gay shows there are so few of them and people place so many expectations of what they need it to be And the fact that this had a little bit of subversiveness to it and was a little bit politically incorrect and it was featuring Ian and Derek it had to bear extra weight\\n\\nPerhaps more unusual than a show about gay people is to have a show about old people\\n\\nThats exactly what I felt too There are six characters in the show and five of them are in their late 60s or 70s That never happens And theyre vital Theyre not the sidebar to somebody else Theyre not the adjunct The young man is the one whos trying to be in their world\\n\\nSo those accusations about dated stereotypes might reflect people not knowing older gay men\\n\\nI cant say that I would have had the courage to come out in the way they would have had to do What they had to deal with in the 60s is why I can be where I am now Its so easy to say the men of that generation are too camp What men of that generation had to go through when they were in their 20s to swim against the tide to not get married to not pretend you have a

Frances de la Tour again one of the great actors of her generation Shes playing a role thats very similar to her character on the British sitcom Rising Damp from the 1970s there are almost predatory elements in the way she comes on to Iwan Rheons character Ash Tell me how you see Violet\\n\\nWhat I love about Violet is that this is a woman whos in her 60s whos never been married who doesnt have children whos worked for herself and whos lived her own life Shes teasing Ash because she can and shes getting a rise out of him Shes enjoying herself The way Frances does it theres a wink to what

these celebrated Theres a certain negativity to the boys especially Freddie who looks at everything through a very negative prism But everything is an opportunity an adventure to her\\n\\nEven in these enlightened times people still seem to have a problem with effeminate or camp gay characters Its OK to be butch but a character whos a bit queeny isnt so wellreceived It was the same with Jack on Will  Grace\\n\\nYes it did happen on Will  Grace There had never been a show that was a mainstream hit before that was told from the point of view of gay men Jack was a threedimensional specific
