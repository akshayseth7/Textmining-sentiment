"{\"Text\": \"Legislative leaders in New York State have agreed on a deal to require public and private colleges to have affirmative consent policies, The New York Times reported. Under such policies, both students must explicitly consent to a sexual act. California has such a law, and a number of New York's public and private colleges and universities have such policies, but the legislation will require all campuses in the state to adopt a core definition for consent and specific language for amnesty and other policies. The legislation has been a major goal of Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, although the version that was enacted differs from what the governor proposed.
