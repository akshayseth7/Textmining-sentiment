"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Matthew Busch/Getty Images\\n\\nIn late July, while touring the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas, Donald Trump wore a baseball cap. This might seem a less-than-noteworthy development. One assumes Trump wore the hat mostly just to corral his cotton-candy hair on a windy day. Yet the online reaction was swift and torrential.\\n\\nSome wondered why a man worth more than TEN BILLION DOLLARS chose a hat that looked to cost about $5.99. Many others, meanwhile, wondered where they could buy one for themselves. The Trump campaign store in Manhattan sold out of the hat within hours, and his website scrambled to make them available for order. One online retailer rushed to fill the void with a line of knockoffs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did the donning of casual headwear become a subject of national fascination? It helps that The Donald is piping hot at the moment, a figure who spurs endless curiosity. Everything he touches turns to tweets. And oh, that photo: the pursed-lipped, squinty-eyed Trump frowning under his new chapeau. Juxtapose almost anything with Trumps sour puss, and youve got yourself an indelible image.\\n\\nBut the fuss was in large part about the hat qua hat. Its text, Make America Great Againa shameless rip-off of Ronald Reagans 1980 campaign slogan Lets Make America Great Again. (Note how Trump tweaks it to be both less inclusive and more bossy.) The hats foamy frontapparently made from a repurposed beer koozie. The double divots framing the central peak. And of course the braided rope that elegantly stretched across its brim.\\n\\nThe rope hat style is on trend these days. Gnarly skateboard periodical Thrasher Magazine sells them in several colors, highlightingin rather Trumpian languagethe classy woven rope that distinguishes its design. Urban Outfitters offers a circa 1992 Wu-Tang rope hat. Vintage rope hats routinely show up on Etsy. In June, a bit more than a month before Trump wore one for the cameras, Golf Digest asked, Are rope hats back to being cool? after one appeared atop the head of 26-year-old PGA tour pro Harris English. This was no mere trucker hat. The rope is a distinctive touch.\\n\\nThe hat is random and startling, and so is the Donald.\\n\\nTheres a fine line here between retro chic and just, like, dorky 9-hole golf course wear. But Trump manages to walk this tightrope with ease. Hes got that quirky, aging rich guy coolthe same kind that turned grandfatherly, 74-year-old Patriots owner Robert Krafts fetish for Nike Lunar Force 1 sneakers into a minisensation in New England last year.\\n\\nAnd then theres the matter of the hats lettering. Rendering Trumps slogan in all caps may actually reduce its legibility, since the lack of shape contrast slows down readers. But so what? Donald Trump is an all-caps kind of guy, says Steven Heller. Heller, co-chair of the MFA in design at New Yorks School of Visual Arts, recently analyzed Trumps typography choices for Wiredbeginning with the giant, brass-colored, TRUMP TOWER sign over the entry of Trumps flagship Fifth Avenue building. Heller notes that the signs typeface, a slab serif style that is likely either Stymie Bold or Lubalin Graph, is very similar to the one Playboy used for its gentlemens clubs in the 1960s. Classy. Luxurious. Heller authored Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State, so he is an authority when he describes the all-caps, chunky serif aesthetic of the hat as imperial.\\n\\nTheres a hat on sale in the Hillary campaign shop that nicely highlights the differences between the two candidates. The Hillary hat has a complicated stitching pattern and colorful underbrim and looks like it was lovingly designed by professional milliners. Ive repeatedly asked the Trump campaign for their hats origin story, and theyve not yet gotten back to me with an answer, but to my eyes the Trump hat looks to have been thrown together last-second by a frazzled intern. Which seems par for the course. Everything about Hillary screams careful preparation while everything about Trump screams winging it.\\n\\nJerry McLaughlin, co-founder of Branders.com, spent 15 years making merchandise for political campaigns. In his eyes, the purpose of all this swag is not for the campaign to make money. Generally, they might end up making a few bucks, he says. But this is not a meaningful source of revenue for them. Its not a commercial enterprise. Its more, Lets not lose money doing this.  Even the Obama campaigns reported $40 million revenue from its high-fashion 2012 merchandise line was a drop in the bucket, to McLaughlins thinking. Its still small numbers compared to the billion dollars it takes to run a presidential campaign. And thats when you have Anna Wintour shaping your products.\\n\\nSurprisingly, McLaughlin doesnt even consider campaign merch a form of advertising. He doesnt think seeing a Hillary hat on someone elses head will turn you into a Hillary voter. Its more that it cements the wearer closely to the candidate, he argues. I wear your hat and, because Ive announced publicly my affiliation with you, I find myself more committed. Ill take more actions on behalf of you. Subconsciously, by wearing the gear, we get ourselves more deeply involved. This is key when it comes to squeezing more volunteer work out of supporters or further donations as the election approaches.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"matthew\"], [\"matthew\",

1980 campaign slogan Lets Make America Great Again Note how Trump tweaks it to be both less inclusive and more bossy The hats foamy frontapparently made from a repurposed beer koozie The double divots framing the central peak And of course the braided rope that elegantly stretched across its brim\\n\\nThe rope hat style is on trend these days Gnarly skateboard periodical Thrasher Magazine sells them in several colors highlightingin rather Trumpian languagethe classy woven rope that distinguishes its design Urban Outfitters offers a circa 1992 WuTang rope hat Vintage rope hats routinely show up on Etsy In June a bit more than a month before Trump wore one for the cameras Golf Digest asked Are rope hats back to being cool after one appeared atop the head of 26yearold PGA tour pro Harris English This was no mere trucker hat The rope is a distinctive touch\\n\\nThe hat is random and startling and so is the Donald\\n\\nTheres a fine line here between retro chic and just like dorky 9hole golf course wear But Trump manages to walk this tightrope with ease Hes got that quirky aging rich guy coolthe same kind that turned grandfatherly 74yearold Patriots owner Robert Krafts fetish for Nike Lunar Force 1 sneakers into a minisensation in New England last year\\n\\nAnd then theres the matter of the hats lettering Rendering Trumps slogan in all caps may actually reduce its legibility since the lack of shape contrast slows down readers But so what Donald Trump is an allcaps kind of guy says Steven Heller Heller cochair of the MFA in design at New Yorks School of Visual Arts recently analyzed Trumps typography choices for Wiredbeginning with the giant brasscolored TRUMP TOWER sign over the entry of Trumps flagship Fifth Avenue building Heller notes that the signs typeface a slab serif style that is likely either Stymie Bold or Lubalin Graph is very similar to the one Playboy used for its gentlemens clubs in the 1960s Classy Luxurious Heller authored Iron Fists Branding the 20thCentury Totalitarian State so he is an authority when he describes the allcaps chunky serif aesthetic of the hat as imperial\\n\\nTheres a hat on sale in the Hillary campaign shop that nicely highlights the differences between the two candidates The Hillary hat has a complicated stitching pattern and colorful underbrim and looks like it was lovingly designed by professional milliners Ive repeatedly asked the Trump campaign for their hats origin story and theyve not yet gotten back to me with an answer but to my eyes the Trump hat looks to have been thrown together lastsecond by a frazzled intern Which seems par for the course Everything about Hillary screams careful preparation while everything about Trump screams winging it\\n\\nJerry McLaughlin cofounder of Branderscom spent 15 years making merchandise for political campaigns In his eyes the purpose of all this swag is not for the campaign to make money Generally they might end up making a few bucks he says But this is not a meaningful source of revenue for them Its not a commercial enterprise Its more Lets not lose money doing this  Even the Obama campaigns reported 40 million revenue from its highfashion 2012 merchandise line was a drop in the bucket to McLaughlins thinking Its still small numbers compared to the billion dollars it takes to run a presidential campaign And thats when you have Anna Wintour shaping your products\\n\\nSurprisingly McLaughlin doesnt even consider campaign merch a form of advertising He doesnt think seeing a Hillary hat on someone elses head will turn you into a Hillary voter Its more that it cements the wearer closely to the candidate he argues I wear your hat and because Ive announced publicly my affiliation with you I find myself more committed Ill take more actions on behalf of you Subconsciously by wearing the gear we get ourselves more deeply involved This is key when it comes to squeezing more volunteer work out of supporters or further donations as
