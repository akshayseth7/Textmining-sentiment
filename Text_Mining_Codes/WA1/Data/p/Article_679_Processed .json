"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it had declined to review a federal appeals courts decision upholding New Jerseys ex-gay conversion therapy ban. That law, signed by Gov. Chris Christie in 2013, forbids any licensed therapist from attempting to convert minors from gay to straight. (Gender conversion therapy, which is sometimes forced on transgender individuals in a similar fashion, was not addressed in this law.) It only applies to children under 18, and doesnt affect the rights of unlicensed private counselors. The Supreme Court has already refused to review a nearly identical California law upheld by a different appeals court.\\n\\nObviously, its difficult from these two decisions to get a glimpse into the justices thoughts on ex-gay conversion therapy. Still, Id take Mondays rejection as reason for very cautious optimism. The court often refuses to address an issue until a circuit split emergesthat is, until different appeals courts have reached different conclusions about a matter of law. But any four justices can vote to bring a case before the court, and sometimes a bloc of concerned justices will intervene absent a circuit split when they feel a lower court has gone egregiously awry.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"chip\"], [\"chip\", \"somodevillagetty\"], [\"somodevillagetty\", \"image\"], [\"image\", \"monday\"], [\"monday\", \"supreme\"],
