"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\\n\\nMost of the time, when we talk about immigration, were talking about Latin America. Donald Trump isnt threatening to round up Irish immigrants in Boston who entered the country illegally or to build a wall between us and Canada; hes threatening Latinos and tapping into an ugly strain of racist nativism. Its why anchor babyslang for the American-born children of unauthorized immigrantsis such a charged term. To many, its racial code for often brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking children.\\n\\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.\\n\\nOf course, rhetoric aside, Americas immigrant community goes beyond Latino and Hispanic Americans. It includes Africans, Europeans, and Asians, one of the fastest growing groups in the country. Not all Asians are tied to the immigrant experiencemore than a quarter are native-born, with long and durable ties to the United States. But the large majority are foreign-born, with roots in a variety of different countries, from China and Japan to Korea, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh. Moreover, theyre a rising share of the electoratein 1996, just 1.6 percent of voters were Asian. In 2012, it was 3.4 percent. As second- and third-generation Asian Americans take the stage in national life, that voting block will increase.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Republicans attack immigrationand increasingly, immigrantswe know it alienates Hispanic and Latino voters. Indeed, between Trump and his chorus of imitators, the party has all but abandoned its outreach to that community. But in this analysis, we shouldnt ignore Asian Americans. This rhetoric matters to them too, and if Republicans arent careful, theyre set to lose two groups and likely seal their fate for next November.\\n\\nHow do we know that Asian voters care about immigration? Lets look back to the previous presidential election. So little of how Barack Obama won in 2012 was a surprise. He captured young voters and cleaned up with single women; he struck gold with Latinos and won the entire black vote, again; and he was weak, as expected, with most white Americans. However, there was one shock: Obama scored an enormous win among Asians. His 73 percent share of the Asian vote was a significant increase from the previous election and a bright spot in his overall performance.\\n\\nIt would have been one thing if, like blacks, Asians were Democratic stalwarts. But they werent. A solid 44 percent supported George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, and a sizable minority35 percentvoted for John McCain in the 2008 election. The reason is straightforward: As a whole, Asians are closer to the social and economic mainstream than other minority groups. They are the highest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States, notes the Pew Research Center. They are more satisfied than the general public with their lives, finances and the direction of the country, and they place more value than other Americans do on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success.\\n\\nIn 2012, Asians were primed to follow the national trend and vote a little more Republican. But they didnt. Just 26 percent voted for Mitt Romney, the lowest GOP total in 20 years. What happened? What turned a small Democratic edge into an outright advantage?\\n\\nAgain, the answer is immigration, and specifically, the sense of exclusion that came from the GOP. In the 2012 primary, like this one, Republicans were torn over immigration policy, with candidates having a strong incentive to oppose comprehensive reform. Throughout the primary process, candidates fought to surpass one another with draconian solutions for dealing with unauthorized immigrants, with Romney touting self-deportation in his pitch to Republican voters. He won the nomination, but the phrase was an albatross on his general election campaign. In a 2014 study, researchers at Vanderbilt University measured the impact of that rhetoric on Asian voters. How would they react to feeling excluded or questioned on their citizenship? The simple intervention of making an Asian subject feel excluded with respect to Americanness and being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen increased negative dispositions towards the Republican Party and increased positive views of the Democratic Party, write the authors. Put simply, when confronted with exclusionary rhetoric, Asian voters tied the Republican Party to racial discrimination.\\n\\nLast year, in the midterm elections, it looked like Republicans recovered from their 2012 rout with Asians. In exit polls, 50 percent voted for Democrats, versus 49 percent for Republicans. If thats accurate, then the picture isnt as bad as it seems. But theres always been a midterm swing toward Republicans, and several pollsincluding in-language surveys from polling firm Asian American Decisionsshow a larger Democratic advantage than appears in that exit poll. Indeed, in its recent probe of party affiliation, Pew found an almost 3-to-1 divide among Asians: 65 percent identified with the Democratic Party, 23 percent with the GOP.\\n\\nStill, outreach isnt hopeless, especially in an open election year without an incumbent on the ballot. But that assumes that Republicans can get their base under control, or at least behind rhetoric that doesnt antagonize immigrant groups and those with ties to immigrant communities. This could happen, but because of Trump, it looks like a long shot. Trump isnt just popular; hes shaping Republican policy, and several candidates have even turned against birthright citizenshipa historic achievement of the onceparty of Lincoln.\\n\\nMaybe this wont matter for 2016. After all, most Americans arent paying attention to the race thus far. But thats small consolation. Democrats are watching the Republican primary. They are recording and polling and testing. Come next year, they will blanket immigrant communities with the greatest hits of Republican rhetoric, and over the course of the campaign, countless peopleteachers, factory workers, small business people, and otherswill remember the comments about illegals and anchor babies. And theyll act accordingly. In turn, this will leave Republicans in a tight spot. To win without minorities, theyll have to find and mobilize even more white voters: men and women who arent as tied to the political system, people who are angry and disaffected from their leaders. Trump supporters.\\n\\nOn Friday, a writer for the Federalista conservative websiteasked if the GOP was the party of freedom or the party of white identity. If the party keeps moving on its present path, there will be no answer but the latter.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"sandy\"], [\"sandy\", \"huffakergetty\"], [\"huffakergetty\", \"image\"],

democratic stalwarts but they werent a solid 44 percent supported george w bush in the 2004 presidential election and a sizable minority35 percentvoted for john mccain in the 2008 election the reason is straightforward as a whole asians are closer to the social and economic mainstream than other minority groups they are the highestincome besteducated and fastestgrowing racial group in the united

the gop in the 2012 primary like this one republicans were torn over immigration policy with candidates having a strong incentive to oppose comprehensive reform throughout the primary process candidates fought to surpass one another with draconian solutions for dealing with unauthorized immigrants with romney touting selfdeportation in his pitch to republican voters he won the nomination but the phrase was an albatross on his general election campaign in a 2014 study researchers at vanderbilt university measured the impact of that rhetoric on asian voters how would they react to feeling excluded or questioned on their citizenship the simple intervention of making an asian subject feel excluded with respect to americanness and being suspected of not being a us citizen increased negative dispositions towards the republican party and increased positive views of the democratic party write the authors put simply when confronted with exclusionary rhetoric asian voters
