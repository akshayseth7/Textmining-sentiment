"{\"Text\": \"On January 27, 1991, at a record-release party for the rap duo Bytches With Problems in Hollywood, producer/rapper/then-N.W.A. member Dr. Dre brutally attacked Dee Barnes, the host of a well-known Fox show about hip-hop called Pump It Up! Dre was reportedly angry about a Pump It Up! segment hosted by Barnes that aired in November 1990. The report focused on N.W.A., and concluded with a clip of Ice Cube, who had recently left the group, insulting his former colleagues. Soon after the attack, Barnes described it in interviews: She said Dre attempted to throw her down a flight of stairs, slammed her head against a wall, kicked her, and stomped on her fingers. Dre later told Rolling Stone, It aint no big thing  I just threw her through a door. He pleaded no contest to assault charges. Barness civil suit against Dre was settled out of court.\\n\\nBarnes agreed to watch F. Gary Grays just-released film about N.W.A, Straight Outta Compton, and reflect on it for Gawker.\\n\\nI never experienced police harassment until I moved to California in the 80s. The first time it happened, I had just left a house party that erupted in gunfire. A cop pulled me over and ordered me out of the car. I was 19, naive, and barefoot. When I made a move to get my shoes, the cop became aggressive. He manhandled me because he supposedly thought I was grabbing for a weapon. Im lucky he didnt shoot me. There I was, face down on the ground, knee in my back. In June, I was reminded of what happened to me when I watched video of a police officer named Eric Casebolt grabbing a 15-year-old girl outside the Craig Ranch North Community Pool in Texas, slamming her body to the ground, and putting his knee in her back.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThree years laterin 1991I would experience something similar, only this time I was on my back and the knee was in my chest. That knee did not belong to a police officer, but Andre Young, the producer/rapper who goes by Dr. Dre. When I saw the footage of California Highway Patrol officer Daniel Andrew straddling and viciously punching Marlene Pinnock in broad daylight on the side of a busy freeway last year, I cringed. That must have been how it looked as Dr. Dre straddled me and beat me mercilessly on the floor of the womens restroom at the Po Na Na Souk nightclub in 1991.\\n\\nThat event isnt depicted in Straight Outta Compton, but I dont think it should have been, either. The truth is too ugly for a general audience. I didnt want to see a depiction of me getting beat up, just like I didnt want to see a depiction of Dre beating up Michelle, his one-time girlfriend who recently summed up their relationship this way: I was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat on and told to sit down and shut up.\\n\\nBut what should have been addressed is that it occurred. When I was sitting there in the theater, and the movies timeline skipped by my attack without a glance, I was like, Uhhh, what happened? Like many of the women that knew and worked with N.W.A., I found myself a casualty of Straight Outta Comptons revisionist history.\\n\\nDre, who executive produced the movie along with his former groupmate Ice Cube, should have owned up to the time he punched his labelmate Tairrie B twice at a Grammys party in 1990. He should have owned up to the black eyes and scars he gave to his collaborator Michelle. And he should have owned up to what he did to me. Thats reality. Thats reality rap. In his lyrics, Dre made hyperbolic claims about all these heinous things he did to women. But then he went out and actually violated women. Straight Outta Compton would have you believe that he didnt really do that. It doesnt add up. Its like Ice Cube saying, Im not calling all women bitches, which is a position he maintains even today at age 46. If you listen to the lyrics of A Bitch Iz a Bitch, Cube says, Now the title bitch dont apply to all women / But all women have a little bitch in em. So which is it? You cant have it both ways. Thats what theyre trying to do with Straight Outta Compton: Theyre trying to stay hard, and look like good guys.\\n\\nI knew the guys of N.W.A. years before they blew up. I first met Andre (whos wonderfully portrayed by Corey Hawkins in Compton) when he lived with his cousin Jinx, who would later introduce me to OShea Jackson, a.k.a. Ice Cube. I was at Lonzos house when Andre and Antoine Carraby, a.k.a. Yella, were both still in the World Class Wreckin Cru. I was there at the radio station KDAY with Greg Mack. Later, while they were creating the N.W.A and the Posse album, I would meet MC Ren and Arabian Prince. It was at Lonzos studio that my best friend Rose Hutchinson and I formed the rap group Body and Soul. We spent countless days and nights at Lonzos house, and in his studio we recorded a demo produced by both Dr. Dre and DJ Pooh. It was there where I also met Eric Wright, a.k.a. Eazy E. These men became my brothers.\\n\\nI wasnt in the studio to hear them record their disgusting, misogynistic views on women in songs like A Bitch Iz a Bitch, Findum, Fuckum & Flee, One Less Bitch, and perhaps most offensively, She Swallowed It. (On that track, MC Ren brags about violating at 14-year-old girl: Oh shit its the preachers daughter! / And shes only 14 and a ho / But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro.) I heard the material like everybody else, when I was listening to the albums, and I was shocked. Maybe that was their point. Maybe they said a lot of that stuff for the shock value. There were always other girls around, like Michelle and Rose, and we never heard them talk like that. We never heard them say, Bitch, get over here and suck my dick. In their minds, only certain women were like that, and Ive never presented myself like that, so I never gave them a reason to call me names.\\n\\nAccurately articulating the frustrations of young black men being constantly harassed by the cops is at Straight Outta Comptons activistic core. There is a direct connection between the oppression of black men and the violence perpetrated by black men against black women. It is a cycle of victimization and reenactment of violence that is rooted in racism and perpetuated by patriarchy. If the breadth of N.W.A.s lyrical subject matter was guided by a certain logic, though, it was clearly a caustic logic.\\n\\nIt was so caustic that when Dre was trying to choke me on the floor of the womens room in Po Na Na Souk, a thought flashed through my head: Oh my god. Hes trying to kill me. He had me trapped in that bathroom; he held the door closed with his leg. It was surreal. Is this happening? I thought.\\n\\nTheir minds were so ignorant back then, claiming that I set them up and made them look stupid. That wasnt a setup. It was journalism and television, first of all, and secondly, I had nothing to do with the decision to run the package as it did. After an interview with N.W.A., the segment ended with Ice Cube saying I got all you suckers 100 miles and runnin, and then, imitating N.W.A. affiliate the D.O.C.: Id like to give a shoutout to the D.O.C. Yall cant play me. I was a pawn in the game. I was in it, but so was a true opportunist: the director of Straight Outta Compton, F. Gary Gray.\\n\\n\\n\\nThats right. F. Gary Gray, the man whose film made $60 million last weekend as it erased my attack from history, was also behind the camera to film the moment that launched that very attack. He was my cameraman for Pump It Up! You may have noticed that Gary has been reluctant to address N.W.A.s misogyny and Dres attack on me in interviews. I think a huge reason that Gary doesnt want to address it is because then hed have to explain his part in history. Hes obviously uncomfortable for a reason.\\n\\nGary was the one holding the camera during that fateful interview with Ice Cube, which was filmed on the set of Boyz N the Hood. I was there to interview the rapper Yo Yo. Cube was in a great mood, even though he was about to shoot and he was getting into character.\\n\\nCube went into a trailer to talk to Gary and Pump It Up! producer Jeff Shore. I saw as he exited that Cubes mood had changed. Either they told him something or showed him the N.W.A. footage we had shot a few weeks earlier. What ended up airing was squeaky clean compared to the raw footage. N.W.A. were chewing Cube up and spitting him out. I was trying to do a serious interview and they were just clowningtalking shit, cursing. It was crazy.\\n\\nRight after we shot a now-angry Cube and they shouted, Cut! one of the producers said, Were going to put that in. I said, Hell no. I wasnt even thinking about being attacked at the time, I was just afraid that they were going to shoot each other. I didnt want to be part of that. This is no laughing matter, I tried telling them. This is no joke. These guys take this stuff seriously. I was told by executives that I was being emotional. Thats because Im a woman. They would have never told a man that. They would have taken him seriously and listened.\\n\\nIt was that interview that was the supposed cause of Dres attack on me, as many of his groupmates attested. My life changed that night. I suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack. I love Dres song Keep Their Heads Ringinit has a particularly deep meaning to me. When I get migraines, my head does ring and it hurts, exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall. People have accused me of holding onto the past; Im not holding onto the past. I have a souvenir that I never wanted. The past holds onto me.\\n\\nPeople ask me, How come youre not on TV anymore? and How come youre not back on television? Its not like I havent tried. I was blacklisted. Nobody wants to work with me. They dont want to affect their relationship with Dre. Ive been told directly and indirectly, I cant work with you. I auditioned for the part that eventually went to Kimberly Elise in Set It Off. Gary was the director. This was long after Pump it Up!, and I nailed the audition. Gary came out and said, I cant give you the part. I asked him why, and he said, Cause Im casting Dre as Black Sam. My heart didnt sink, I didnt get emotional; I was just numb.\\n\\nMost recently, I tried to get a job at Revolt. Ive known Sean (Combs) for years and have the utmost respect for him. Still nothing. Instead of doing journalism, Ive had a series of 9-5 jobs over the years to make ends meet.\\n\\nTheres a myth that I was paid so well by the settlement I received from Dre that Id never have to work again. People think I was paid millions, when in reality, I didnt even get a million, and it wasnt until September of 1993. He and his lawyers dragged their feet the whole way. He stopped coming to court, they kept postponing it. I was tired, and, toward the end, pregnant, but I still tried to show up for everything. And I never thought I was going to have to stop doing what I loved for my job. That was the furthest thing from my mind.\\n\\nThe last time I saw Dre, and was up close and personal with him, we were cordial but not friendly. That was years ago, before Guilty Conscience, the 1999 Eminem/Dre collaboration that references me (You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?). I most recently saw Cube at the Kings of the Mic show at Los Angeless Greek Theater in 2013. We talked briefly and he was very unfriendly. Standoffish, even.\\n\\nThere were two things that made me emotional while watching Straight Outta Compton. The first was the scene where D.O.C. is in the hospital after a car accident that nearly decapitated him. I went to see him then, and I was devastated. I thought he was going to die. I saw him fresh, when he was hooked up to life support and had blood and cuts still visible.\\n\\nThe other scene was Eazys death. I got a chance to see him prior to his dying of AIDS-related complications in March of 1995, maybe about a month before. I briefly owned a production company. Our office was on Melrose, and we shared it with another production company. Eazy came in to the other production company to look for a director for a Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony video. I didnt know he was coming, he didnt know I was going to be there. It was just a pure blessing. I am so grateful I had the opportunity to make peace with him before he passed. We hugged, we kissed, we talked, and I felt good when I saw him, but I knew something was wrong. He didnt look well. I thought maybe he just had a cold. He wasnt coughing, the way it was dramatized in the movie. He sounded congested and he looked skinny. We had a nice conversation and I felt really good about it.\\n\\nI believe that if Eazy were alive, neither Tairrie B., nor JJ Fad wouldnt have been ignored in the movie. Eazy was the straight shooter of the group and he just would have kept it more real. JJ Fad was a trio of female rappers from Rialto, California, whose debut album was released by Ruthless in order to establish and legitimize the label. It was commercially successful and featured the mega hit Supersonic, produced by Arabian Prince, who appears only briefly in Straight Outta Compton. JJ Fads success paved the way for the release of the Straight Outta Compton album. Its a very pivotal moment that was erased from N.W.A.s story. Its easy for them to be dismissive of women, because they dont respect most women.\\n\\nWith the exception of short scenes with mother figures and wives, the rest of the women in the film were naked in a hotel room or dancing in the background at the wild pool parties. Yo Yo, a female rapper who worked with Ice Cube after he left N.W.A., was nowhere to be found. Nor are women who worked with Dre later in his career, like Jewell and the Lady of Rage. They both contributed tremendously to the ultimate sound of the classic album The Chronic. What about Ruthless R&B singer-song-writer Michelle, who at the young age of 17 was singing vocals on World Class Wreckin Crus Turn Off The Lights? Michelle and Dr. Dre developed a personal and professional association and he went on to produce her two best-known hits, No More Lies and Something In My Heart. Both songs reflected their volatile relationship. Then there is Ruthless Records/Comptown Records solo female artist/Eazy Es protege Tairrie B, the first white female hardcore rapper. A bold blonde at the time who wasnt afraid to speak her mind, Tairrie B released an album named The Power Of A Woman (how fitting!) and dropped singles like Murder She Wrote and Ruthless Bitch.\\n\\nIn 1990, at a Grammys party in front of an A-List crowd, Dr. Dre assaulted Tairrie B. This was a year before my assault. In an interview, F. Gary Gray said these were considered side stories and not important to the narrative.\\n\\nIf thats the case, its too bad for the movie and its too bad for its audience. Straight Outta Compton transforms N.W.A. from the worlds most dangerous rap group to the worlds most diluted rap group. In rap, authenticity matters, and gangsta rap has always pushed boundaries beyond whats comfortable with hardcore rhymes that are supposed to present accounts of the streets harsh realities (though N.W.A. shared plenty of fantasies, as well). The biggest problem with Straight Outta Compton is that it ignores several of N.W.A.s own harsh realities. Thats not gangsta, its not personal, its just business. Try as they might, too much of N.W.A.s story aint that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug.

that aired in november 1990 the report focused on nwa and concluded with a clip of ice cube who had recently left the group insulting his former colleagues soon after the attack barnes described it in interviews she said dre attempted to throw her down a flight of stairs slammed her head against a wall kicked her and stomped on her fingers dre later told rolling stone it aint no big thing  i just threw her through a door he pleaded no contest to assault charges barness civil suit against dre was settled out of court\\n\\nbarnes agreed to watch f gary grays justreleased film about nwa straight outta compton and reflect on it for gawker\\n\\ni never experienced police harassment until i moved to california in the 80s the first time it happened i had just left a house party that erupted in gunfire a cop pulled me over and ordered me out of the car i was 19 naive and barefoot when i made a move to get my shoes the cop became aggressive he manhandled me because he supposedly thought i was grabbing for a weapon im lucky he didnt shoot me there i was face down on the ground knee in my back in june i was reminded of what happened to me when i watched video of a police officer named eric casebolt grabbing a 15yearold girl outside the craig ranch north community pool in texas slamming her body to the ground and putting his knee in her back\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nthree years laterin 1991i would experience something similar only this time i was on my back and the knee was in my chest that knee did not belong to a police officer but andre young the producerrapper who goes by dr dre when i saw the footage of california highway patrol officer daniel andrew straddling and viciously punching marlene pinnock in broad daylight on the side of a busy freeway last year i cringed that must have been how it looked as dr dre straddled me and beat me mercilessly on the floor of the womens restroom at the po na na souk nightclub in 1991\\n\\nthat event isnt depicted in straight outta compton but i dont think it should have been either the truth is too ugly for a general audience i didnt want to see a depiction of me getting beat up just like i didnt want to see a depiction of dre beating up michelle his onetime girlfriend who recently summed up their relationship this way i was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat on and told to sit down and shut up\\n\\nbut what should have been addressed is that it occurred when i was sitting there in the theater and the movies timeline skipped by my attack without a glance i was like uhhh what happened like many of the women that knew and worked with nwa i found myself a casualty of straight outta comptons revisionist history\\n\\ndre who executive produced the movie along with his former groupmate ice cube should have owned up to the time he punched his labelmate tairrie b twice at a grammys party in 1990 he should have owned up to the black eyes and scars he gave to his collaborator michelle and he should have owned up to what he did to me thats reality thats reality rap in his lyrics dre made hyperbolic claims about all these heinous things he did to women but then he went out and actually violated women straight outta compton would have you believe that he didnt really do that it doesnt add up its like ice cube saying im not calling all women bitches which is a position he maintains even today at age 46 if you listen to the lyrics of a bitch iz a bitch cube says now the title bitch dont apply to all women  but all women have a little bitch in em so which is it you cant have it both ways thats what theyre trying to do with straight outta compton theyre trying to stay hard and look like good guys\\n\\ni knew the guys of nwa years before they blew up i first met andre whos wonderfully portrayed by corey hawkins in compton when he lived with his cousin jinx who would later introduce me to oshea jackson aka ice cube i was at lonzos house when andre and antoine carraby aka yella were both still in the world class wreckin cru i was there at the radio station kday with greg mack later while they were creating the nwa and the posse album i would meet mc ren and arabian prince it was at lonzos studio that my best friend rose hutchinson and i formed the rap group body and soul we spent countless days and nights at lonzos house and in his studio we recorded a demo produced by both dr dre and dj pooh it was there where i also met eric wright aka eazy e these men became my brothers\\n\\ni wasnt in the studio to hear them record their disgusting misogynistic views on women in songs like a bitch iz a bitch findum fuckum  flee one less bitch and perhaps most offensively she swallowed it on that track mc ren brags about violating at 14yearold girl oh shit its the preachers daughter  and shes only 14 and a ho  but the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro i heard the material like everybody else when i was listening to the albums and i was shocked maybe that was their point maybe they said a lot of that stuff for the shock value there were always other girls around like michelle and rose and we never heard them talk like that we never heard them say bitch get over here and suck my dick in their minds only certain women were like that and ive never presented myself like that so i never gave them a reason to call me names\\n\\naccurately articulating the frustrations of young black men being constantly harassed by the cops is at straight outta comptons activistic core there is a direct connection between the oppression of black men and the violence perpetrated by black men against black women it is a cycle of victimization and reenactment of violence that is rooted in racism and perpetuated by patriarchy if the breadth of nwas lyrical subject matter was guided by a certain logic though it was clearly a caustic logic\\n\\nit was so caustic that when dre was trying to choke me on the floor of the womens room in po na na souk a thought flashed through my head oh my god hes trying to kill me he had me trapped in that bathroom he held the door closed with his leg it was surreal is this happening i thought\\n\\ntheir minds were so ignorant back then claiming that i set them up and made them look stupid that wasnt a setup it was journalism and television first of all and secondly i had nothing to do with the decision to run the package as it did after an interview with nwa the segment ended with ice cube saying i got all you suckers 100 miles and runnin and then imitating nwa affiliate the doc id like to give a shoutout to the doc yall cant play me i was a pawn in the game i was in it but so was a true opportunist the director of straight outta compton f gary gray\\n\\n\\n\\nthats right f gary gray the man whose film made 60 million last weekend as it erased my attack from history was also behind the camera to film the moment that launched that very attack he was my cameraman for pump it up you may have noticed that gary has been reluctant to address nwas misogyny and dres attack on me in interviews i think a huge reason that gary doesnt want to address it is because then hed have to explain his part in history hes obviously uncomfortable for a reason\\n\\ngary was the one holding the camera during that fateful interview with ice cube which was filmed on the set of boyz n the hood i was there to interview the rapper yo yo cube was in a great mood even though he was about to shoot and he was getting into character\\n\\ncube went into a trailer to talk to gary and pump it up producer jeff shore i saw as he exited that cubes mood had changed either they told him something or showed him the nwa footage we had shot a few weeks earlier what ended up airing was squeaky clean compared to the raw footage nwa were chewing cube up and spitting him out i was trying to do a serious interview and they were just clowningtalking shit cursing it was crazy\\n\\nright after we shot a nowangry cube and they shouted cut one of the producers said were going to put that in i said hell no i wasnt even thinking about being attacked at the time i was just afraid that they were going to shoot each other i didnt want to be part of that this is no laughing matter i tried telling them this is no joke these guys take this stuff seriously i was told by executives that i was being emotional thats because im a woman they would have never told a man that they would have taken him seriously and listened\\n\\nit was that interview that was the supposed cause of dres attack on me as many of his groupmates attested my life changed that night i suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack i love dres song keep their heads ringinit has a particularly deep meaning to me when i get migraines my head does ring and it hurts exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall people have accused me of holding onto the past im not holding onto the past i have a souvenir that i never wanted the past holds onto me\\n\\npeople ask me how come youre not on tv anymore and how come youre not back on television its not like i havent tried i was blacklisted nobody wants to work with me they dont want to affect their relationship with dre ive been told directly and indirectly i cant work with you i auditioned for the part that eventually went to kimberly elise in set it off gary was the director this was long after pump it up and i nailed the audition gary came out and said i cant give you the part i asked him why and he said cause im casting dre as black sam my heart didnt sink i didnt get emotional i was just numb\\n\\nmost recently i tried to get a job at revolt ive known sean combs for years and have the utmost respect for him still nothing instead of doing journalism ive had a series of 95 jobs over the years to make ends meet\\n\\ntheres a myth that i was paid so well by the settlement i received from dre that id never have to work again people think i was paid millions when in reality i didnt even get a million and it wasnt until september of 1993 he and his lawyers dragged their feet the whole way he stopped coming to court they kept postponing it i was tired and toward the end pregnant but i still tried to show up for everything and i never thought i was going to have to stop doing what i loved for my job that was the furthest thing from my mind\\n\\nthe last time i saw dre and was up close and personal with him we were cordial but not friendly that was years ago before guilty conscience the 1999 eminemdre collaboration that references me you gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes i most recently saw cube at the kings of the mic show at los angeless greek theater in 2013 we talked briefly and he was very unfriendly standoffish even\\n\\nthere were two things that made me emotional while watching straight outta compton the first was the scene where doc is in the hospital after a car accident that nearly decapitated him i went to see him then and i was devastated i thought he was going to die i saw him fresh when he was hooked up to life support and had blood and cuts still visible\\n\\nthe other scene was eazys death i got a chance to see him prior to his dying of aidsrelated complications in march of 1995 maybe about a month before i briefly owned a production company our office was on melrose and we shared it with another production company eazy came in to the other production company to look for a director for a bonethugsnharmony video i didnt know he was coming he didnt know i was going to be there it was just a pure blessing i am so grateful i had the opportunity to make peace with him before he passed we hugged we kissed we talked and i felt good when i saw him but i knew something was wrong he didnt look well i thought maybe he just had a cold he wasnt coughing the way it was dramatized in the movie he sounded congested and he looked skinny we had a nice conversation and i felt really good about it\\n\\ni believe that if eazy were alive neither tairrie b nor jj fad wouldnt have been ignored in the movie eazy was the straight shooter of the group and he just would have kept it more real jj fad was a trio of female rappers from rialto california whose debut album was released by ruthless in order to establish and legitimize the label it was commercially successful and featured the mega hit supersonic produced by arabian prince who appears only briefly in straight outta compton jj fads success paved the way for the release of the straight outta compton album its a very pivotal moment that was erased from nwas story its easy for them to be dismissive of women because they dont respect most women\\n\\nwith the exception of short scenes with mother figures and wives the rest of the women in the film were naked in a hotel room or dancing in the background at the wild pool parties yo yo a female rapper who worked with ice cube after he left nwa was nowhere to be found nor are women who worked with dre later in his career like jewell and the lady of rage they both contributed tremendously to the ultimate sound of the classic album the chronic what about ruthless rb singersongwriter michelle who at the young age of 17 was singing vocals on world class wreckin crus turn off the lights michelle and dr dre developed a personal and professional association and he went on to produce her two bestknown hits no more lies and something in my heart both songs reflected their volatile relationship then there is ruthless recordscomptown records solo female artisteazy es protege tairrie b the first white female hardcore rapper a bold blonde at the time who wasnt afraid to speak her mind tairrie b released an album named the power of a woman how fitting and dropped singles like murder she wrote and ruthless bitch\\n\\nin 1990 at a grammys party in front of an alist crowd dr dre assaulted tairrie b this was a year before my assault in an interview f gary gray said these were considered side stories and not important to the narrative\\n\\nif thats the case its too bad for the movie and its too bad for its audience straight outta compton transforms nwa from the worlds most dangerous rap group to the worlds most diluted rap group in rap authenticity matters and gangsta rap has always pushed boundaries beyond whats comfortable with hardcore rhymes that are supposed to present accounts of the streets harsh realities though nwa shared plenty of fantasies as well the biggest problem with straight outta compton is that it ignores several of nwas own harsh realities thats not gangsta its not personal its just business try as they might too much of nwas story aint that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug you

history was also behind the camera to film the moment that launched that very attack He was my cameraman for Pump It Up You may have noticed that Gary has been reluctant to address NWAs misogyny and

trying to do a serious interview and they were just clowningtalking shit cursing It was crazy\\n\\nRight after we shot a nowangry Cube and they shouted Cut one of the producers said Were going to put that in I said Hell no I wasnt even thinking about being attacked at the time I was just afraid that they were going to shoot each other I didnt want to be part of that This is no laughing matter I tried telling them This is no joke These guys take this stuff seriously I was told by executives that I was being emotional Thats because Im a woman They would have never told a man that They would have taken him seriously and listened\\n\\nIt was that interview that was the supposed cause of Dres attack on me as many of his groupmates attested My life changed that night I suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack I love Dres song Keep Their Heads Ringinit has a particularly deep meaning to me When I get migraines my head does ring and it hurts exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall People have accused me of holding onto the past Im not holding onto the past I have a souvenir that I never wanted The past holds onto me\\n\\nPeople ask me How come youre not on TV anymore and How come youre not back on television Its not like I havent tried I was blacklisted Nobody wants to work with me They dont want to affect their relationship with Dre Ive been told directly and indirectly I cant work with you I auditioned for the part that eventually went to Kimberly Elise in Set It Off Gary was the director This was long after Pump it Up and I nailed the audition Gary came out and said I cant give you the part I asked him why and he said Cause Im casting Dre as Black Sam My heart didnt sink I didnt get emotional I was just numb\\n\\nMost recently I tried to get a job at Revolt Ive known Sean Combs for years and have the utmost respect for him Still nothing Instead of doing journalism Ive had a series of 95 jobs over the years to make ends meet\\n\\nTheres a myth that I was paid so well by the settlement I received from Dre that Id never have to work again People think I was paid millions when in reality I didnt even get a million and it wasnt until September of 1993 He and his lawyers dragged their feet the whole way He stopped coming to court they kept postponing it I was tired and toward the end pregnant but I still tried to show up for everything And I never thought I was going to have to stop doing what I loved for my job That was the furthest thing from my mind\\n\\nThe last time I saw Dre and was up close and personal with him we were cordial but not friendly That was years ago before Guilty Conscience the 1999 EminemDre collaboration that references me You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes I most recently saw Cube at the Kings of the Mic show at Los Angeless Greek Theater in 2013 We talked briefly and he was very unfriendly Standoffish even\\n\\nThere were two things that made me emotional while watching Straight Outta Compton The first was the scene where DOC is in the hospital after a car accident that nearly decapitated him I went to see him then and I was devastated I thought he was going to die I saw him fresh when he was hooked up to life support and had blood and cuts still visible\\n\\nThe other scene was Eazys death I got a chance to see him prior to his dying of AIDSrelated complications in March of 1995 maybe about a month before I briefly owned a production company Our office was on Melrose and we shared it with another production company Eazy came in to the other production company to look for a director for a BoneThugsnHarmony video I didnt know he was coming he didnt know I was going to be there It was just a pure blessing I am so grateful I had the opportunity to make peace with him before he passed We hugged we kissed we talked and I felt good when I saw him but I knew something was wrong He didnt look well I thought maybe he just had a cold He wasnt coughing the way it was dramatized in the movie He sounded congested and he looked skinny We had a nice conversation and I felt really good about it\\n\\nI believe that if Eazy were alive neither Tairrie B nor JJ Fad wouldnt have been ignored in the movie Eazy was the straight shooter of the group and he just would have kept it more real JJ Fad was a trio of female rappers from Rialto California whose debut album was released by Ruthless in order to establish and legitimize the label It was commercially successful and featured the mega hit Supersonic produced by Arabian Prince who appears only briefly in Straight Outta Compton JJ Fads success paved the way for the release of the Straight Outta Compton album Its a very pivotal moment that was erased from NWAs story Its easy for them to be dismissive of women because they dont respect most women\\n\\nWith the exception of short scenes with mother figures and wives the rest of the women in the film were naked in a hotel room or dancing in the background at the wild pool parties Yo Yo a female rapper who worked with Ice Cube after he left NWA was nowhere to be found Nor are women who worked with Dre later in his career like Jewell and the Lady of Rage They both contributed tremendously to the ultimate sound of the classic album The Chronic What about Ruthless RB singersongwriter Michelle who at the young age of 17 was singing vocals on World Class Wreckin Crus Turn Off The Lights Michelle and Dr Dre developed a personal and professional association and he went on to produce her two bestknown hits No More Lies and Something In My Heart Both songs reflected their volatile relationship Then there is Ruthless RecordsComptown Records solo female artistEazy Es protege Tairrie B the first white female hardcore rapper A bold blonde at the time who wasnt afraid to speak her mind Tairrie B released an album named The Power Of A Woman how fitting and dropped singles like Murder She Wrote and Ruthless Bitch\\n\\nIn 1990 at a Grammys party in front of an AList crowd Dr Dre assaulted Tairrie B This was a year before my assault In an interview F Gary Gray said these were considered side stories and not important to the narrative\\n\\nIf thats the case its too bad for the movie and its too bad for its audience Straight Outta Compton transforms NWA from the worlds most dangerous rap group to the worlds most diluted rap group In rap authenticity matters and gangsta rap has always pushed boundaries beyond whats comfortable with hardcore rhymes that are supposed to present accounts of the streets harsh realities though NWA shared plenty of fantasies as well The biggest problem with Straight Outta Compton is that it ignores several of NWAs own harsh realities Thats not gangsta its not personal its just business Try as they might too much of NWAs story aint that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug You know\\n\\nDee Barnes is currently writing
