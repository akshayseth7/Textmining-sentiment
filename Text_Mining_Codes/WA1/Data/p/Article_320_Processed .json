"{\"Text\": \"Drawing by ESO/L. Calcada\\n\\nIts time to take a step out into the greater Universe in Crash Course Astronomy. Sure, exoplanets and brown dwarfs got us out of the solar system, but when you want to understand whats going on in the cosmos, you have to look at stars.\\n\\nWe dipped into them in Episode 26, but now its time to start poking into their guts in detail. The basic events in any stars life occur in low mass stars, ones from red dwarfs up to a few times the mass of Sun. Things get different when higher mass stars start to die, so well hit that when we get into that end of the HR diagram (whats that, you ask? Click the Episode 26 link!).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Episode 29, Low Mass Stars, I talk about their lives and deaths. Mind you, since the Sun is in that range, well, well have to look that eventuality in the face as well. And since the Earth orbits the Sun, you can guess what that means for our fair world.\\n\\nThe good news is that the events that will unfold wont do so for billions of years. Billions, with a b. Weve come a long way in the past century or two  heck, we understand stars well enough to make educational videos about them  so who knows where well be in a hundred million centuries.\\n\\nPhil Plait Phil Plait writes Slates Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!\\n\\nIn my book, Death from the Skies!, I cover all this, including the death of the Sun and likely vaporization of Earth. I also talk about the idea of using the gravitational effects of slinging thousands of big asteroids past the Earth to move its orbit out so that it can maintain a constant temperature while the Sun goes red giant. Theres a great journal paper about this online; if you want details theyre there. Its what I based that part of the chapter on.\\n\\nSee? Theres hope! And if were being honest, my biggest hope is that we wont need to do this to save the Earth at all. By then, instead, well have spread out into the galaxy, and those beyond.
