"{\"Text\": \"Slate's Eric Holthaus wrote in June that California, though it's suffering a severe drought, is still better off than Puerto Rico. The U.S. territory has been enduring a similar lack of rainfall, but lacks the water-related infrastructure that helps mitigate California's shortagesand is also involved in a crisis over $73 billion in public debt it says it can't pay. Things have only gotten worse as the summer has gone on, and households that had been getting running water every three days are now down to getting it only twice a week.
