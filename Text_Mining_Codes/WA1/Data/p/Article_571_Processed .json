"{\"Text\": \"Photo courtesy Sony Pictures Classics\\n\\nWhen youre a teenage girl, its hard to know the shape of your own sexuality. Before you can even begin to suss out its contours from within, you feel such pressure from without. Parents want to deny it. Your friends want to egg it on. Authorities want to control it. The media want to capitalize on it. Teenage boys, walloped by their own suddenly turbocharged libidos, want to bulldoze it. And grown men, who stare and follow and otherwise try to insinuate themselves into your confidence, want things that seem both terrifying and thrilling.\\n\\nLaura Miller Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for Slate and the author of The Magicians Book: A Skeptics Adventures in Narnia.\\n\\nBut what do teenage girls want? Stuck at the center of this maelstrom of other peoples fears and fascination, how can they even tell? There has never been a better medium to explore this question than the novel, with its unfettered access to the interior recesses of the self. The inner life of a teenage girl can be like an unstable weather system, shot through with squalls, inexplicably balmy interludes, and stretches of drab rain. Writers have used first-person narration to chart this mercurial climate in books ranging from Jane Eyre to I Capture the Castle to Oranges are Not the Only Fruit. Carson McCullers The Member of the Wedding (among others) proved that the third-person does justice to a teen girls yearnings, too.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe movies can claim far fewer triumphs in this department. Partly this is the result of the medium itself, which can only show us the outsides of people and then encourage us to infer whats happening within. The outsides of pretty girls have long been one of films favorite subjects, too, an interest that only occasionally extends to the girls own thoughts and desires. Mena Suvaris cheerleader character in American Beauty is the archetype: mooned over as a sublime, rose-strewn ideal by Kevin Spaceys Lester Turnham, despite the girls actual vapidity. Other teenage girls, like the titular sisters of The Virgin Suicides, are presented as ciphers to the men who long for or even possess them. The Jeffrey Eugenides novel on which it was based succeeds where the film fails in conveying how mens desires can sometimes blind them to womens humanity. Trained by a lifetime of watching films in which the surfaces of girls are all that matter, we moviegoers are sometimes blinded too. Lolita weeps inconveniently in the next room, and Humbert Humbert turns a deaf ear.\\n\\nThe outsides of pretty girls have long been one of films favorite subjects.\\n\\nMinnie Goetze isnt a big crier, though. True, the main character and subject of Marielle Hellers exhilarating directorial debut The Diary of a Teenage Girl doesnt come out of her hair-raising adventures without shedding her fair share of tears, but those tears are not the point. Fifteen-year-old Minnie, played with gleaming intensity by Bel Powley, has an affair with her mothers boyfriend (twice her age), hooks up with guys from school, sleeps with a dangerously charming lesbian, and even briefly experiments with prostitution alongside her best friend Kimmiebefore both girls decide that was gross and vow never to do it again. Yet The Diary of a Teenage Girl is not, as you might expect from this precis, a cautionary tale. Minnie is ravenous for experience, particularly of the erotic variety, and living with a hip, lackadaisical single mom (played by Kristen Wiig) in 1970s San Francisco, she has plenty of opportunities to satisfy her curiosity, and her lust.\\n\\nTheres something transgressive about even typing the word lust in reference to a 15-year-old. Isnt She wanted it! the habitual excuse of abusers and other skeevy men? It is, but pretending that 15-year-old girls never feel carnal desire, or only feel it toward appropriate partners, does another kind of damage. No doubt thats one reason why Heller has pursued this project so ardently, from the moment eight years ago when she first read the novel (told in comics and text) of the same title by Phoebe Gloeckner. Since then, Heller has retold Gloeckners story in an off-Broadway stage production (in which she played Minnie), and now in a film, which she both wrote and directed. You feel stupid for having these thoughts or feeling like theyre wrong, Heller told the Los Angeles Times. I just feel like this film is doing a service to young women, like, its OK, youre all normal, youre fine.\\n\\nMinnies experience isnt every girls, but it is entirely hers. The Diary of a Teenage Girl avoids the voyeurism that threatens any film about a young girls sexuality by burying itself in Minnies sensibility. At times, her drawings and doodles (shes an aspiring cartoonist) commandeer the screen, worming their way over the photographed images like ivy engulfing a stone wall. Cleverly, Heller has cast outrageously sexy actors in the roles of Minnies lovers: Alexander Skarsgard as Monroe, her mothers feckless boyfriend, and Margarita Levieva as the lesbian junkie who finally takes Minnie to the limits of her daring. (It crossed my mind that their characters might really be far less attractive, and only Minnie, in her fever, sees them as Skarsgard and Levieva.)\\n\\nCourtesy of North Atlantic Books\\n\\nAbove all, the movie has Powleys face, which like Giulietta Masinas or Maria Falconettis has the power to fill and transfigure the frame. With her huge, round, heavy-lidded eyes, Powley inhales and possesses the movies point of view. Technically, we know her character is being taken advantage of, but on screen, shes the queen of her worldan often goofy and callow queen, but a queen all the same. Nobody loves you. Nobody sees you. Nobody touches you, Minnie tells herself, which is both the reason why her desire has enjoyed enough space to flourish on its own, and not quite true. The audience loves, sees, and inhabits her.\\n\\nHellers version of The Diary of a Teenage Girl is several shades sunnier than Gloeckners. The book is semi-autobiographical and some of its passages are lifted directly from Gloeckners own girlhood diary; Gloeckner, too, had an affair with her mothers boyfriend. But while Glockners Monroe is the initiator of the affair, Hellers version of the character serves more as a willing participant, albeit one who eventually lets Minnie down by refusing to fulfill her romantic dreams. (Basically, hes hung up on her mom.) Their clinches evolve out of bouts of boisterous horseplay, juvenile hijinks that make Monroe seem not much more than a big kid himself.\\n\\nThat doesnt of course, mean that Monroe isnt wrong to have sex with Minnie, however much she pesters him for it; he is in fact a statutory rapist. He has no right to decide that their relationship is acceptable, regardless of what Minnie says, and regardless of whether or not she suffers any lasting harm as the result of it. (Gloeckner has said that she regards the relationship that inspired her book as sexual abuse, because he didnt see the love I had for him. I actually really loved him. But I think that meant nothing for him, or he would laugh it off.)\\n\\nHowever, Monroes abuse doesnt define Minnie, either. When other filmsAndrea Arnolds excellent 2009 feature Fish Tank comes to mindhave dealt with similar relationships, were meant to understand the girl as used, motivated by emotional rather than sexual hunger. Minnie, on the other hand, feels pleasure and wants more of it, seeking out casual trysts with a classmate who finds her passion disconcerting and says (in a paraphrase of the book), Having sex with you kind of scares me. This prompts an animated fantasia in which a giant woman strides down a San Francisco street and scoops up a cowering male figure in her mammoth fist.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"courtesy\"],
