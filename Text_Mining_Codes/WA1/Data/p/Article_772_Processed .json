"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images\\n\\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court refused to review a lower court ruling upholding Californias ban on gay conversion therapy, allowing the law to stand. Advocates for such therapymostly conservative Christiansinsist that the ban violates would-be therapists freedom of speech. Following the courts move, theyll likely turn their sights to a similar law in New Jersey in another attempt to appeal their case to the justices.\\n\\nAs Ive written before, California and New Jerseys bans on anti-gay conversion therapy are very obviously constitutional. They dont forbid parents or relatives or friends or preachers from attempting to convert gay people to heterosexuality. These laws only prevent licensed mental health professionals from converting patients; if they break the law, they simply lose their license. Its a narrowly tailored, eminently sensible way to curb a dangerous, suicide-inducing practice that is condemned by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Medical Association.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven that these bans are laser-focused to target a single, destructive practice, Id be surprised if the Supreme Court agreed to review the New Jersey banor any other similarly worded law. The constitutional question is just so easy that the case would be a waste of the justices time at this point. My greater fear is that a dark blue state will overreach, pulling non-professionals into the sweep of the law. If that happens, the conservative Christians who want to force young Americans into the misery of conversion would actually have a case.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"win\"], [\"win\",
