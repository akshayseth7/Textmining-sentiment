"{\"Text\": \"As officials deal with public worry over toxic fallout from the massive explosions at a chemical storage facility near the Tianjin port last week, photos of fish carcasses washed up on the shore of the Haihe River have been making rounds on social media:\\n\\nEnvironmental officials have reported toxic levels of cyanide in nearby waterways, but have also said that the citys drinking water remains safe and stressed that mass fish die-off is a common summer phenomenon in the region. The New York Times Dan Levin and Javier C. Hernandez report:\\n\\nThrongs of curious onlookers gathered on Thursday on the banks of the Haihe River to take pictures of the grim scene of dead fish, while officials tried to reassure the public. Mass die-offs are not unusual in the summer, when oxygen levels in the polluted river water can fall sharply, the officials said. The state-owned China Central Television reported later that tests found no significant presence of cyanide in that part of the river. [...] Photos of the dead fish were posted widely on Chinese social media, feeding public worries over the tons of chemicals that were in the warehouse. The authorities have already said the logistics company that operated the facility broke the law by storing such dangerous materials too close to apartment houses, highways and public buildings.
