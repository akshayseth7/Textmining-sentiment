What else could explain the death of so many?\\n\\nTianjin officials have attempted to reassure the public saying that the dead fish were caused by regular seasonal low oxygen levels in the water and were not related to the blasts.\\n\\nThe state-owned China Central Television also reported that tests found no significant presence of cyanide in that section of the river.\\n\\nGreenpeace have said that tests around the blast site indicate that water supplies were not severely contaminated with cyanide, but that they did not disprove the presence of other hazardous chemicals in the water.\\n\\nAt least 114 people were killed in the blasts on 12 August, while 65 people remain missing and presumed dead from the disaster.\\n\\nOver 6,000 people have been displaced by the event and
