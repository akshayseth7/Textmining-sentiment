"{\"Text\": \"Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for official correspondence during her time as Secretary of State has not become a career-threatening scandal, Slate 's Jamelle Bouie wrote recently , but it's a perennially available opportunity for her opponents to hammer away gradually at voters' perception of her trustworthiness. On that front, someone close to a certain former opponent of Clinton's just took a pretty spicy shot at her via NYU professor and Time columnist Ian Bremmer:\\n\\nThat's presumably a reference specifically to Clinton having used the private server for correspondence related to classified information, which is potentially a crime. The question is how \\\"senior\\\" this official was and whether he or she got clearance from the White House to take the jab at Clinton, but Bremmer hasn't provided any more context yet. (I can't think of any reason besides partisan Bidenism that saying something like this would benefit anyone in the administration, but maybe that's why I'm writing this from a blogging van down by the river and not a luxurious political consultant's office.)\\n\\n\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"hillary\", \"clinton\"], [\"clinton\", \"use\"], [\"use\", \"private\"], [\"private\", \"email\"], [\"email\",
