"{\"Text\": \"Topics: Martin O'Malley, Marco Rubio, NPR, Steve Inskeep, Economics, 2016 Elections, Social Security, Hillary Clinton, Taxes, Deregulation, Elections News, News, Politics News\\n\\nAs someone who curses quite a bit in my professional life, I was encouraged to hear that former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley had  on NPR, of all places  referred to Marco Rubios economic worldview as bullshit. The interview was interesting for other, better reasons, and it was actually fairly rich in policy detail, which Ill get into in a moment, but I do want to carve out a special appreciation for the act of going on public radio as a potential candidate for the nations highest office and letting rip with a little salty language.\\n\\nOMalleys people are presenting it as a spontaneous moment of real-keeping and are actually fundraising off of bullshit, which is itself a wry commentary on the subject matter of a typical fundraising email. And because I want the rest of the world to sink to my level, its my fervent hope that OMalley has touched off something of a linguistic race-to-the-bottom and now well see Hillary Clinton tell Wolf Blitzer that Ted Cruzs tax plan is a turd waffle, or something similarly juvenile.\\n\\nBut what I like most about OMalley dismissing Rubios economic outlook as bullshit is that hes not wrong. NPRs Steve Inskeep had asked OMalley about Rubios views on how regulations on businesses impact upward mobility, which Rubio had laid out in an NPR interview a week earlier. In that interview, Rubio tried making a populist case for deregulation, arguing that regulations only serve to stack the deck in favor of banks and large corporations. The fact is that big government helps the people who have made it, Rubio said. If you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, youll benefit. And so thats why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.\\n\\nThats complete, well, bullshit. Republicans like Marco Rubio evangelize deregulation not because itll give a leg up to the little guy, but because thats exactly what banks and big businesses (and the wealthy political donors who run them) prefer as a policy outcome. Theres a rich historical record of deregulation broadening the gap between the wealthy and the non-wealthy, and someone who argues otherwise is, in fact, bullshitting you.\", \"Text_Bigrams\":
