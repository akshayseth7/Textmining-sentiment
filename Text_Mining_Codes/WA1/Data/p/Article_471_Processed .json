"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n\\nJeb Bushs attempt to echo Donald Trumps un-PC talk on immigration by unapologetically using the derogatory term anchor baby is getting him hit from both sides of the aisle.\\n\\nThey're called babies. https://t.co/VyJJA26OVl  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 19, 2015\\n\\nJeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term \\\"anchor babies,\\\" offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2015\\n\\nTheyre not wrong!\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nJeb first used the term earlier this week while weighing in on birthright citizenship the granting of citizenship to anyone born in the countrywhich has become the latest topic du jour in the GOP race in the wake of Donald Trumps proposal to end it. Bush is against going that far, but says that the U.S. government should do a better job of preventing pregnant women from crossing the border to have their children. Thats [the] legitimate side of this, the GOP hopeful said on Bill Bennetts conservative radio show on Wednesday. Better enforcement so that you dont have these, you know, anchor babies, as theyre described, coming into the country.\\n\\nAs you can tell by the you know that preceded the term, and the as theyre described that followed, the words anchor babies didnt exactly roll off Bushs tongue. Thats probably because, according to the Washington Post, it was the first time hes uttered the term publicly on the campaign trail. Its difficult to say whether Jeb intentionally decided to drop anchor baby into his talking point in a bid to appeal to immigration hard-liners or if it simply slipped out. (Ive listened to the clip a dozen times, and could be convinced of either.) Regardless, he has decided to try to own it. Given the chance to walk it back on Thursday, Bush pressed ahead. \\\"Do you have a better term? You give me a better term and I'll use it,\\\" he snapped at a reporter.\\n\\nHow about \\\"babies,\\\" \\\"children,\\\" or \\\"American citizens.\\\" https://t.co/ofxEG6Za00  Hillary Clinton
