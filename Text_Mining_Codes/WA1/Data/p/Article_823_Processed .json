"{\"Text\": \"Photo by Jeff Fusco/Getty Images\\n\\nJoe Bidens presidential trial balloon just got a little bigger. The latest burst of speculation came Thursday night in the form a New York Times report that the vice president is using his South Carolina vacation to talk with allies and advisers about laying the groundwork for a White House run. And, in case that wasnt enough to get everyones attention, Carl Bernstein (of Woodward-and fame) made it more tantalizing when he suggested Friday that if Biden does run, he may do so with the promise that hed only serve one term.\\n\\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\\n\\nSo what to make of all this? For starters, the topline takeawayJoe Biden may run for president!is nothing new. Politicos and pundits have been talking about it in earnest for going on two months now. What makes it fresh, though, is the specificity of the latest speculation. Biden still hasnt made up his mind but he really does appear to be pressing forward just in case.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Times reports that Biden has given the greenlight to his closest advisers to discreetly contact operatives in early nominating states to determine how fast they could organize a campaign, and the independent Draft Biden super PAC has entered a new, more aggressive phase that resembles an exploratory committee. Bernsteins pseudo-prediction, meanwhile, makes it clear that someone on Team Biden is already testing out a possible campaign message that would differentiate the veep from Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.\\n\\nNone of that, though, tells us whether Biden will actually run. He still has plenty of reasons to stay on the sidelines. And given Clintons massive advantages in fundraising, endorsements, and campaign infrastructurenot to mention the pollsthe steps he is taking now are just the necessary ones to keep his options open.\\n\\nThe latest silly-season chatter doesnt tell us a whole lot about Biden, but it does tell us something about the woman hed need to best for his partys nomination. Much of the press and public is clearly bored with Clinton. Some of that is due to Hillary herselfits unclear if she could run an exciting campaign even if she needed toand some of that is due to her status as the overwhelming favorite in a nominating contest that wont officially end for another year. For anyone treating the Democratic nomination as a horse race, thered be nothing more exciting than a new horseeven if it were an old one. Exhibit B: the short-lived rumor that Al Gore was thinking about making another go of it.\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"jeff\"], [\"jeff\", \"fuscogetty\"], [\"fuscogetty\", \"image\"],
