"{\"Text\": \"Courtesy of Ballymore Group\\n\\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\\n\\nHave you ever gone swimming and thought to yourself, Gee, this is fun, but it would be a whole lot better if I were doing this about 10 stories in the air and it felt like I was flying? Well, youre in luck: Londons glass-encased, 82-foot-long sky pool is perfect for you.\\n\\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\\n\\nThe proposed sky poolwhich is expected to be completed by 2018will exist as a kind of bridge between two residential buildings in Embassy Gardens, a 2,000-home complex near the American Embassy in Londons Nine Elms district. Its the brainchild of Sean Mulryan, the chairman and CEO of Ballymore Group, which developed the complex. But the aquarium-like structure needed an actual aquarium designer, as well as a team of glass and marine designers, to help out Arup Associates, the pools designers.\\n\\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\\n\\nMy vision for the sky pool stemmed from a desire to push the boundaries in the capability of construction and engineering. I wanted to do something that had never been done before, Mulryan, told Home and Property. It will feel like floating through the air in central London.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile a gimmick like the sky pool seems like it was created to go viral, some, such as Henry Pryor, a buying agent for wealthy clients, are skeptical of its actual appeal. He told the Guardian that he thought the plans for the pool were genuinely crackers and wondered if enough people would actually be interested in swimming in it.\\n\\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\",
