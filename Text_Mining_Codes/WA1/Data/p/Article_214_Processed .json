Step-marriage: Im a 28-year-old woman and have been married five years. My husband and I have a great marriage and cant see ourselves with anyone else. We moved to a new town and have made new friends, and some want to know how we met. I tell them we met in high school, but theres more to it than that. We are also stepsiblings. My mother married his father when we were teens, and that is how we met. We kept it from them, and they found out when we were away at college. We lived together while in school and married after graduation. They were upset, but eventually accepted it. Should we tell others we are also stepsiblings?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\nA: I hope the marriage of your mother and his father has worked out as well! You two are not biologically related and you werent raised togethertheres nothing to be ashamed of regarding your relationship, and you have committed no violation of the incest taboo. But as youre probably aware, your story at the least engenders raised eyebrows and fascination. (I once knew a couple who had the reverse situation from you. Her divorced mother and his widowed father met at their wedding and went on to marry each other.) When youre talking to new acquaintances, sticking to We were high school sweethearts is sufficient. With people you get to know well, your story will unfold more naturally, if you care to get into it. And Id like to know if holidays are easier or harder when you never have to divide them because both sides of the family live under one roof.\\n\\nQ. Buckle Up or Get Out?: I have a rule in my carbuckle up or the car doesnt move. Once in a while, I drive someone who gets really upset at this rule. They tell me theyre adults and are free to make their own decisions. I tell them its my car, Im driving, so I feel liable. (Maybe Im even legally liable, I dont know.) Ive had this rule ever since I got my license, but I feel even more strongly about it since I had an accident and was told that the only reason I didnt die is because I was buckled up. I dont know if I should stick firm to this rulethey are adults and responsible for their own (stupid, life-threatening) decisions, but its my car and Im doing them a favor. Are they right and I should relax this rule?\\n\\nA: I cant believe you have found such a steady stream of morons to take the passenger seat. Do not relax this rule. Children legally must be buckled, but check your state law as to whether adult passengers must be, too. If so, that would allow you to say you are not going to get ticketed for this infraction. But even if you cant cite the law, you can cite common sense. If your passengers dont care about their safety, thats on them. But whats on you is that if an accident happens, an unbuckled body becomes a missile and youre not going to drive anyone who would endanger you.\\n\\nQ. My Son Wants to Reconnect With His Alcoholic Father: I left my abusive and alcoholic husband five years ago. My son and I moved to a new city an hour away to start fresh. It was the best decision I ever made. My son is now 12 and has thrived in the last five years. His father has not contacted him once during this time. I have nursed my sons heartache over having a nonexistent father. Weve had difficult years, but have gotten through them. Hes healthy, intelligent, positive, and has a wonderful sense of humor. Last year I accidentally texted his father instead of my boss (they share similar names). His father called me, was verbally abusive, and said I took his son away from him. We still have joint custody, hoping that someday he would reach out to his son. Well, early this spring, his father texted me to check in about Jack. We began to exchange texts weekly about Jack. Things were friendly, and Jack was able to meet his father last June, with the agreement that Jacks uncle also be there. The visit was fine. A few weeks ago, I agreed to let Jack text his father. Again, things were fine until last week. His father sent a series of mean texts to me and my son. We both backed away, and I asked his father not to contact us unless he was willing to be civil. My son still wants to have a connection with his father and asked if he can see him again. Even with my ex-BIL present, I am having a hard time with this. I dont know what to do. I dont want to say no to my son, but I have been there for all the bad days and dont want him to go through the same hurt all over again. He realizes that his father is not well and takes it for what it is. What should I do?\", \"Text_Bigrams\": [[\"photo\", \"teresa\"], [\"teresa\", \"castracane\"], [\"castracane\", \"emily\"], [\"emily\", \"yoffe\"], [\"yoffe\", \"aka\"], [\"aka\", \"dear\"],
