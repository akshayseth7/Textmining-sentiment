She felt naked until she became a canvas of red, white and blue.\n\nThis was part of Ms. Ovalles\u2019s daily routine as a desnuda, a Spanish word meaning naked that has been embraced by the women who strut around the Times Square pedestrian plaza topless and covered in body paint to pose for photos in exchange for tips.\n\nMs. Ovalles is one of the newest participants to join the parade of seminude performers contributing to the carnival-like atmosphere amid the sea of tourists. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s a lot of people who see me naked,\u201d Ms. Ovalles, 27, said. \u201cIt\u2019s too fun. It\u2019s totally different.\u201d\n\nThe earliest sighting of a desnuda seems to date to the summer of 2013, according to posts on social media. But this summer, on any given day, there are at least a dozen young women, primarily Latinas, of all heights and body shapes, strolling through the pedestrian plazas, trying to capitalize on this suggestive performance art.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Ovalles, who is from Venezuela, had been living in Miami and working as a waitress at a Colombian restaurant when a cousin, Charly Santos, asked if she would like to work with his wife, Paola Pe\u00f1a, in Times Square. He explained the job. Ms. Ovalles was open to the idea but wondered how much money she could make. After Mr. Santos showed her videos of the desnudas on YouTube, she succumbed to the allure of adventure and moved to New York in April.\n\nHer daily income varies, she said, but it averages about $300 \u2014 around $100 more than she was making in Miami. She said she gets anywhere from $5 to $20 in tips for each photo.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do nothing bad because the people like it,\u201d Ms. Ovalles said. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other job in another place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTIMES SQUARE, of course, is home to a hotbed of performers, an eclectic cast of costumed characters that include superheroes, Disney icons and green Statues of Liberty, all vying for tourists\u2019 money. Their proliferation has provoked turf fights and altercations with visitors and the police, in some cases resulting in arrests. Some of them straddle the line between soliciting tips and aggressive panhandling.\n\nThe desnudas have carved a conspicuous niche for themselves \u2014 a mix of Las Vegas showmanship and New York flair. Their success has even eaten into the business of more established and better-known risqu\u00e9 performers.\n\n\u201cAll the people who come to Times Square are looking for the Naked Cowboy, not the naked women,\u201d said Patricia Burck, who is married to the Naked Cowboy, whose real name is Robert Burck.\n\nMs. Burck, 28, and her sister, Elizabeth Cruz, 26, wear bedazzled bikinis and play guitar as the Naked Cowgirls year-round. Ms. Burck said tips drop 50 percent in the summer when the seminude women return to Times Square.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have some respect for a lot of people especially because there\u2019s kids around,\u201d Ms. Burck said. \u201cI\u2019m still shy to be walking in a bikini. I can\u2019t imagine being naked.\u201d\n\nPutting aside questions of modesty and propriety, the seminude women have the law on their side. The baring of female breasts in public was deemed legal in New York by the state\u2019s highest court two decades ago.\n\nStill, the performers have attracted criticism.\n\nThe women have been the subject of about four out of every five complaints received by email and on Twitter since June by the Times Square Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes business in the area. Half are from those who say they are offended by the partial nudity, and the other half are from people who say they do not appreciate being touched by the women or claim they were hassled for money, according to Caitlin Lewis, a spokeswoman for the alliance. Most of those who complain say they work in Times Square.\n\n\u201cYesterday two of them came up to me and pressed themselves up against me trying to get me to stop and take a picture,\u201d David, whose last name was redacted by the alliance, wrote in an email. \u201cNot only was this uncomfortable, but their body paint rubbed off on my suit. This creates an atmosphere that I do not want to bring my kids around.\u201d\n\nPolice Commissioner William J. Bratton also does not support what the women do, though there is little his officers can do to stop them.\n\n\u201cIt drives me crazy when at Times Square you see the naked people there covered in body paint as an expression of art,\u201d Mr. Bratton said in a recent interview with City & State magazine on the subject of questionable street behavior. Yet, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve researched that top to bottom and we cannot find any law that allows us to interfere with that freedom of expression reflected through art form.\u201d\n\nMANY OTHERS do not object at all to the seminude women: They include men of every age as well as women who applaud the liberation of the female breast and who are fans of body art. Others embrace the painted women who unabashedly bare their bodies as another aspect of unpredictable New York City fun.\n\nRandy and Diana Quate were traveling with a group of visitors from Findlay, Ohio, when they came across the women. Mr. Quate, 67, smiled as he stood between two performers. Ms. Quate, 59, took a photo, and afterward Mr. Quate tipped them $8 to divide.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re naked, but it\u2019s still covered,\u201d Ms. Quate said. \u201cI\u2019m not offended.\u201d\n\nHer husband added, \u201cWe\u2019re open-minded people.\u201d\n\nMs. Ovalles insisted that her body was a form of artwork. Nearly every day, Ms. Ovalles, Mr. Santos and Ms. Pe\u00f1a leave their one-bedroom apartment in Queens toting a large drawstring bag stuffed with wedge heels, sandals, paint, feathered headdresses, plenty of water and soft wipes for the start of their 10- to 12-hour day.\n\nAs they work, Mr. Santos sits at a table in the center of the plaza to touch up Ms. Pe\u00f1a and Ms. Ovalles as well as keep an eye out for anyone who tries to grope them. Other desnudas\u2019 boyfriends, who double as painters, sit together at the table and borrow one another\u2019s brushes.\n\nMs. Ovalles plans to return to Miami in September, when the weather in New York becomes too cool for her. She has also considered returning to her career as a flight attendant, a job she left behind in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nFor now, she is focused on her work here. \u201cYou don\u2019t have much time,\u201d she said. \u201cJust sleep and Times Square.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeed904235215b082e201"}}
