The latest burst of speculation came Thursday night in the form a New York Times report that the vice president is using his South Carolina vacation to talk with allies and advisers about laying the groundwork for a White House run. And, in case that wasn\u2019t enough to get everyone\u2019s attention, Carl Bernstein (of Woodward-and fame) made it more tantalizing when he suggested Friday that if Biden does run, he may do so with the promise that he\u2019d only serve one term.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nSo what to make of all this? For starters, the topline takeaway\u2014Joe Biden may run for president!\u2014is nothing new. Politicos and pundits have been talking about it in earnest for going on two months now. What makes it fresh, though, is the specificity of the latest speculation. Biden still hasn\u2019t made up his mind but he really does appear to be pressing forward just in case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Times reports that Biden has given the greenlight to his closest advisers \u201cto discreetly contact operatives in early nominating states to determine how fast they could organize a campaign,\u201d and the independent Draft Biden super PAC \u201chas entered a new, more aggressive phase that resembles an exploratory committee.\u201d Bernstein\u2019s pseudo-prediction, meanwhile, makes it clear that someone on Team Biden is already testing out a possible campaign message that would differentiate the veep from Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.\n\nNone of that, though, tells us whether Biden will actually run. He still has plenty of reasons to stay on the sidelines. And given Clinton\u2019s massive advantages in fundraising, endorsements, and campaign infrastructure\u2014not to mention the polls\u2014the steps he is taking now are just the necessary ones to keep his options open.\n\nThe latest silly-season chatter doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot about Biden, but it does tell us something about the woman he\u2019d need to best for his party\u2019s nomination. Much of the press and public is clearly bored with Clinton. Some of that is due to Hillary herself\u2014it\u2019s unclear if she could run an exciting campaign even if she needed to\u2014and some of that is due to her status as the overwhelming favorite in a nominating contest that won\u2019t officially end for another year. For anyone treating the Democratic nomination as a horse race, there\u2019d be nothing more exciting than a new horse\u2014even if it were an old one. Exhibit B: the short-lived rumor that Al Gore was thinking about making another go of it.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf31c04235215b082e48e"}}
