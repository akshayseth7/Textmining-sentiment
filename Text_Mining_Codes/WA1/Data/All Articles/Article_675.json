For some reason, just about all the leading candidates other than The Donald have taken a deeply unpopular position, a known political loser, on a major domestic policy issue. And it\u2019s interesting to ask why.\n\nThe issue in question is the future of Social Security, which turned 80 last week. The retirement program is, of course, both extremely popular and a long-term target of conservatives, who want to kill it precisely because its popularity helps legitimize government action in general. As the right-wing activist Stephen Moore (now chief economist of the Heritage Foundation) once declared, Social Security is \u201cthe soft underbelly of the welfare state\u201d; \u201cjab your spear through that\u201d and you can undermine the whole thing.\n\nBut that was a decade ago, during former President George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to privatize the program \u2014 and what Mr. Bush learned was that the underbelly wasn\u2019t that soft after all. Despite the political momentum coming from the G.O.P.\u2019s victory in the 2004 election, despite support from much of the media establishment, the assault on Social Security quickly crashed and burned. Voters, it turns out, like Social Security as it is, and don\u2019t want it cut.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable, then, that most of the Republicans who would be president seem to be lining up for another round of punishment. In particular, they\u2019ve been declaring that the retirement age \u2014 which has already been pushed up from 65 to 66, and is scheduled to rise to 67 \u2014 should go up even further.\n\nThus, Jeb Bush says that the retirement age should be pushed back to \u201c68 or 70\u201d. Scott Walker has echoed that position. Marco Rubio wants both to raise the retirement age and to cut benefits for higher-income seniors. Rand Paul wants to raise the retirement age to 70 and means-test benefits. Ted Cruz wants to revive the Bush privatization plan.\n\nFor the record, these proposals would be really bad public policy \u2014 a harsh blow to Americans in the bottom half of the income distribution, who depend on Social Security, often have jobs that involve manual labor, and have not, in fact, seen a big rise in life expectancy. Meanwhile, the decline of private pensions has left working Americans more reliant on Social Security than ever.\n\nAnd no, Social Security does not face a financial crisis; its long-term funding shortfall could easily be closed with modest increases in revenue.\n\nStill, nobody should be surprised at the spectacle of politicians enthusiastically endorsing destructive policies. What\u2019s puzzling about the renewed Republican assault on Social Security is that it looks like bad politics as well as bad policy. Americans love Social Security, so why aren\u2019t the candidates at least pretending to share that sentiment?\n\nThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that it\u2019s all about the big money.\n\nWealthy individuals have long played a disproportionate role in politics, but we\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s happening now: domination of campaign finance, especially on the Republican side, by a tiny group of immensely wealthy donors. Indeed, more than half the funds raised by Republican candidates through June came from just 130 families.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd while most Americans love Social Security, the wealthy don\u2019t. Two years ago a pioneering study of the policy preferences of the very wealthy found many contrasts with the views of the general public; as you might expect, the rich are politically different from you and me. But nowhere are they as different as they are on the matter of Social Security. By a very wide margin, ordinary Americans want to see Social Security expanded. But by an even wider margin, Americans in the top 1 percent want to see it cut. And guess whose preferences are prevailing among Republican candidates.\n\nYou often see political analyses pointing out, rightly, that voting in actual primaries is preceded by an \u201cinvisible primary\u201d in which candidates compete for the support of crucial elites. But who are these elites? In the past, it might have been members of the political establishment and other opinion leaders. But what the new attack on Social Security tells us is that the rules have changed. Nowadays, at least on the Republican side, the invisible primary has been reduced to a stark competition for the affections and, of course, the money of a few dozen plutocrats.\n\nWhat this means, in turn, is that the eventual Republican nominee \u2014 assuming that it\u2019s not Mr. Trump \u2014will be committed not just to a renewed attack on Social Security but to a broader plutocratic agenda. Whatever the rhetoric, the GOP is on track to nominate someone who has won over the big money by promising government by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1b104235215b082e3fa"}}
