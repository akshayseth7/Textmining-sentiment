There has to be a link between the dead fish and the blast. What else could explain the death of so many?\u201d\n\nTianjin officials have attempted to reassure the public saying that the dead fish were caused by regular seasonal low oxygen levels in the water and were not related to the blasts.\n\nThe state-owned China Central Television also reported that tests found no significant presence of cyanide in that section of the river.\n\nGreenpeace have said that tests around the blast site indicate that water supplies were not severely contaminated with cyanide, but that they did not \u201cdisprove the presence of other hazardous chemicals in the water\u201d.\n\nAt least 114 people were killed in the blasts on 12 August, while 65 people remain missing and presumed dead from the disaster.\n\nOver 6,000 people have been displaced by the event and shockwaves from the blast were felt by people in apartments several kilometers away.\n\nThe larger explosions were registered as seismic events with the US Geological Survey.\n\nA 3km exclusion zone has been placed around the site and workers were attempting to clear the area before possible rain showers, which could create toxic gas.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf06704235215b082e2ec"}}
