In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\u201d If the world listens, Francis\u2019 words could be equally important.\n\nFrancis goes a step further than scientists are routinely willing to go: He says that if we continue on our current path, we risk destruction not only of the environment but of the basic decency that makes us human. In that sense, his words are relevant far beyond the climate debate.\n\nThe climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. \u2014 Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 18, 2015\n\nIn his letter, Francis concludes no technological miracle can solve the fundamentally intertwined problems of climate change and global poverty. In a typical passage, Francis rails against inequality and the consumption-driven culture that drives climate change:\n\nWe fail to see that some are mired in desperate and degrading poverty, with no way out, while others have not the faintest idea of what to do with their possessions, vainly showing off their supposed superiority and leaving behind them so much waste which, if it were the case everywhere, would destroy the planet. In practice, we continue to tolerate that some consider themselves more human than others, as if they had been born with greater rights.\n\nNowhere is the pope\u2019s call for renewable energy more relevant than in rapidly developing countries like India. On Wednesday India\u2019s government finalized a startling new goal: By 2022 the country plans to install 100 gigawatts of solar panels\u2014a more than 30-fold expansion to a quarter of its overall electricity supply and five times the country\u2019s previous goal. This ambitious target would make India one of the global solar leaders\u2014in 2015 India will install more solar than Germany. Right now the country generates about 65 percent of its electricity by burning coal, and this is a significant commitment to reducing that figure. In the announcement the Indian government called on help from international donors. Unfortunately wealthy countries have devoted a vanishingly small amount of money to combating climate change.\n\nVastly expanding its solar in India isn\u2019t necessarily intended to fight climate change but to relieve its people of poverty\u2014some of the worst in the world. If the rich world wants to act in a moral way on climate, it should build solar panels in India, commit to no new development of fossil energy for its own use, and fully fund its obligations to help the poorest people in the world adapt to a huge problem that was not of their making.\n\nAn estimated 300 million people there\u2014one-quarter of the country\u2014has no access to electricity at all. Just last month the country endured the fifth-deadliest heat wave in world history. In India air conditioning is increasingly becoming a human rights issue. This is what the pope is talking about when he discusses climate change and poverty in the same breath.\n\nAs the first pope from the developing world, Francis, a native of Argentina, has a clear mandate to speak on behalf of the world\u2019s poor. Although the letter was addressed to everyone on Earth, it\u2019s clearly aimed at high-consuming countries like the United States. The average American emits 17 tons of carbon dioxide each year\u2014the highest of any major country, more than double the world average, and 10 times the average person in India.\n\nThe earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. \u2014 Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 18, 2015\n\nFor a 180-page document distributed by the Catholic Church, Pope Francis\u2019 letter is very readable and deeply moving. It\u2019s more like a poetry slam at an Occupy Wall Street rally than a formal church document. Reading it, I felt like Francis was talking directly to me\u2014challenging me to become a better person.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf35604235215b082e4b7"}}
