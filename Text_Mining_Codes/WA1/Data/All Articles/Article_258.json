She showed some frustration over coverage of the issue when a reporter shouted a question as she turned to leave about whether the story would stop getting traction.\n\n\u201cNobody talks to me about it other than you guys,\u201d she said with a shrug.\n\nThe private email server Clinton used during her time as secretary of state was turned over to the FBI last week, amid revelations that investigators have flagged another 305 emails that may contain classified information for intelligence agencies to further review. The intelligence community\u2019s inspector general last week identified two emails in a sample of 40 examined that contained top-secret material.\n\nThe server had been overseen since 2013 by the small Denver IT firm Platte River Networks. Officials have said the FBI investigation is preliminary and have stressed that Clinton is not a target of the investigation.\n\n\n\nDuring her press conference, Clinton offered a thorough but familiar defense of her decision to use a private email server and to delete more than 30,000 emails from her time as secretary of state that she says were \u201cpersonal.\u201d She stressed Tuesday that she did not send classified material or receive anything \u201cmarked classified\u201d at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the fact that I get a lot of attention because I had a personal email account, as did other high-ranking officials in the State Department and elsewhere in the government. And I had not sent classified material, nor received anything marked classified,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with me. And it has nothing to do with the fact that my account was personal. It\u2019s the process by which the government \u2014 and sometimes in disagreements between various agencies of the government, make decisions about what can and can\u2019t be disclosed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m very comfortable that this will eventually get resolved, and the American people will have plenty of time to figure it out.\u201d\n\nTwo sources close to the FBI investigation told NBC that an \u201cattempt\u201d was made to wipe Clinton\u2019s server sometime before it was handed over to the FBI. (It is unclear, however, when that attempt was made.) But federal agents are reportedly confident they can recover at least some of the deleted files.\n\nThe FBI \u201cwill try to figure what\u2019s there, how it got there and who put it there,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nRepublicans were quick to condemn Clinton\u2019s press conference, with a spokeswoman from the Republican National Committee openly wondering, \u201cHow long until Joe Biden announces?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s video of Clinton\u2019s exchange on \u201cwiping\u201d the server:", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef4a04235215b082e259"}}
