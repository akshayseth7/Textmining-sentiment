Asked to plot themselves on the seven-point Kinsey scale, where 0 is completely straight and 6 is totally gay, 5 percent of the men and 3 percent of the women declared themselves a Kinsey 6. Among the under 30s, just 2 percent saw themselves as entirely homosexual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22004235215b082e436"}}
