We feel it before we understand it. That\u2019s why some slurs resonate even when we\u2019re not sure who or what they\u2019re defaming. Consider the strange case of fuckboy, which plays a central role in Nancy Jo Sales\u2019 controversial article, \u201cTinder and the Dawn of the \u2018Dating Apocalypse,\u2019 \u201d in this month\u2019s Vanity Fair. Here are two true statements about the word: Everyone knows what fuckboy means. And no one knows what fuckboy means.\n\nTo be clear, fuckboy has plenty of definitions\u2014so many, in fact, that the word is less interesting for what it means than for why it seems to welcome so many (often mutually exclusive) claims to meaning. And while some of those claims are older than others, none possess anything like universal authority, Sales\u2019 perhaps least of all. Describing how smartphone apps have intensified the dynamics of hookup culture, Sales writes, \u201cA \u2018fuckboy\u2019 is a young man who sleeps with women without any intention of having a relationship with them or perhaps even walking them to the door post-sex. He\u2019s a womanizer, an especially callous one, as well as kind of a loser.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSuccinct and precise as this definition is, it has turned Sales into an object of condescension for some. \u201cFuckboy is not a dating style,\u201d claims Alana Massey, \u201cso much as a worldview that reeks of entitlement but is aghast at the prospect of putting in effort.\u201d Elaborating on this claim over the phone, she told me that, to her, a fuckboy is a man who wants a girlfriend without the attendant responsibilities. Fuckboys \u201cbecome emotional vampires to women who aren\u2019t even their girlfriends.\u201d\n\nIf Sales and Massey agree on anything, it\u2019s that a fuckboy is the worst kind of guy, or at least one who represents the worst trends of the present moment. In her response to Sales, Massey sets out to explain what\u2019s wrong with modern men. Correcting Sales\u2019 definition of fuckboy is simply an opportunity to frame her claims. Their disagreement reflects the varied ways the word is used across a range of communities, designating whatever male behavior a particular culture\u2014or even an individual\u2014identifies as problematic. Where Sales\u2019 and Massey\u2019s definitions both work from within the discourse of women who date men, it takes on a range of different meanings\u2014and inspires different debates\u2014in other contexts.\n\nThis array of meanings is almost certainly a consequence of the complicated uptake and appropriation of fuckboy. Sales nods to the term\u2019s history\u2014\u201cThe word has been around for at least a decade with different meanings\u201d\u2014though she fails to explore that history at all. In our conversation, Massey claimed that fuckboy had entered her social world sometime in the past year, but acknowledged that it had a fuzzier past. \u201cI was told that we stole it from gay men,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t actually know.\u201d\n\nMassey isn\u2019t alone in this any more than she\u2019s alone in feeling that her take on the term is the right one. Though fuckboy plays a role in various linguistic communities, it\u2019s hard to trace it to a single source. These multiple histories\u2014and the ambiguities that arise when they meet\u2014make it difficult to assign a stable, consistent meaning to the term. But something about the word itself inspires strong claims, leading to attempts to assert its meaning once and for all. Instead of simply standing for badness, fuckboy encourages those who use it to discuss what that badness entails.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to locate the origins of fuckboy in prison slang, where, according to some accounts, it refers to \u201cmen who are \u2018gay for pay.\u2019 \u201d Other sources directly connect the term to prison rape, or suggest that it operates in the space where those two meanings overlap. The word has also been associated with gay male culture\u2014though there too it takes on a variety of specific connotations. I\u2019ve heard it used to refer to men who take a submissive role in sex. But one acquaintance told me that, \u201cto gay men like me it means a rich and powerful man\u2019s kept boy.\u201d\n\nBut fuckboy probably found its way into popular parlance through hip-hop. As attempts to historicize the term frequently point out, Cam\u2019ron used it in passing in the chorus of his 2002 \u201cBoy, Boy\u201d: \u201cOh this cat over front? Fuck boy, boy /He keep that shit up \u2026 fucking drop boy, boy.\u201d To Cam\u2019ron a \u201cfuck boy\u201d is apparently a contemptible faker, but the rapper does little to define the term.\n\nAs the Huffington Post\u2019s Sara Boboltz notes, fuckboy has appeared \u201cin a growing number of rap and hip-hop songs\u201d in the decade since Cam\u2019ron first employed it. Unsurprisingly, listeners started noticing the word before journalists did. A 2009 thread in the Hypebeast forums finds users wondering over the word\u2019s derivation while others mock them for arriving late to the party. Significantly, the commenters evince little agreement about fuckboy\u2019s significance or etymology. They propose a variety of possible meanings, all ugly but widely divergent in the specific onus of their ugliness, except insofar as they tend toward a homophobic register.\n\nFor all that history, interest in fuckboy didn\u2019t really start to spike until late 2014\u2014a date that suggests the impact of hip-hop group Run the Jewels\u2019 \u201cOh My Darling Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d released on Sept. 15 of that year. (Thanks to Slate\u2019s Forrest Wickman for making that connection.) On that recording, Killer Mike raps, \u201cThat fuckboy life about to be repealed/ That fuckboy shit about to be repelled/ Fuckboy jihad, kill infidels.\u201d While repetition gives the term weight\u2014more weight, certainly, than it held for Cam\u2019ron\u2014no context clarifies its specific meaning. Coupling uncertain signification with clear significance, \u201cOh My Darling\u201d turns fuckboy into a semiotic black hole, one that pulls everything into itself.\n\nAsked to clarify what he meant, Killer Mike responded, \u201c[Y]ou can identify fuckboys \u2026 because they are always doing fuck shit. Just the dumbest, weirdest, lamest possible shit ever.\u201d In an explanatory note on Genius, a commentator glosses the lines in similarly general terms, enthusing, \u201cWeak lames like don\u2019t stand a chance against [Run the Jewels]!\u201d A fuckboy is recognizable by his objectionable actions. You know one when you see one.\n\nWhile it may not have been important to Run the Jewels to define the term, it must have been to some of the group\u2019s listeners\u2014and to those hearing the word in other contexts. Why else did so many turn to Google in search of a clearer explanation? Popular searches include \u201cwhat is fuckboy,\u201d \u201cdefinition fuckboy,\u201d \u201cdefine fuckboy,\u201d and requests for the term (and variant spellings \u201cfuckboi\u201d and \u201cfuccboi\u201d) in Urban Dictionary.\n\nPerversely, all this uncertainty inspires us to believe that there must be something to be certain about. The further fuckboy gets from its origins\u2014whatever they may be\u2014the more its proponents insist that it means one thing or another, or, as in Massey\u2019s disagreement with Sales, one thing but not another. Urban Dictionary, where visitors vote on the accuracy of user-submitted explanations of slang terms, offers almost 300 attempts to define fuckboy. Some overlap, but without any real consistency, suggesting something more like Wittgensteinian family resemblance insofar as they share only the derisive force of the term itself. The oldest and most popular definition dates to 2004 and simply reads, \u201cA person who is a weak ass pussy that ain't bout shit,\u201d suggesting a failure to conform to masculine norms.\n\nSome subsequent appropriations have inverted this earlier understanding, turning fuckboy into something more like a critique of masculine excess. YouTuber Damian Alonso proposes, \u201cIf you\u2019re a man and you\u2019re calling another man a fuckboy because he\u2019s weak or a pussy, you are now a fuckboy yourself because you\u2019re using sexist language that is prominent in fuckboys.\u201d This take supplants the misogynistic and homophobic implications of fuckboy with accusations of misogyny and homophobia.\n\nIt may be precisely because it arrives without a comprehensible history that fuckboy has come to stand for whatever those who use it find most contemptible. This has instilled it with a hyperspecificity that makes it difficult to discuss in general terms. Articles and explainers about it often come in the form of lists, always lists of signs: \u201c15 Tragic Signs You\u2019re Dealing With a Fuckboy,\u201d \u201c10 Signs He\u2019s a Fuckboy,\u201d \u201c7 SIGNS HE\u2019S A FUCKBOY.\u201d It\u2019s a joke genre, or at least a structure for something like jokes, but it points to the truth of the word: It\u2019s easier to talk about examples than essences.\n\nAs these listicles suggest, fuckboy is a sign in search of meaning, but those meanings can only ever be other signs. Indeed, fuckboy is a sign that endlessly points elsewhere. This is how it can refer both to a man who is \u201cweak or a pussy\u201d and to someone who refers to others as \u201cweak or a pussy.\u201d Significantly, though, it never stands fully apart from its racially and sexually overdetermined history. That history lingers in the background of more recent understandings, problematically underwriting badness as such, badness without content.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c804235215b082e46d"}}
