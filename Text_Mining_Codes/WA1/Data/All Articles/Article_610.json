Crafted in his years as the \u201csocialist\u201d Independent senator from Vermont, the proposal is at the center of his surprisingly robust campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.\n\nIf elected president (with a Democratic Congress), Sanders would end tuition for public colleges and universities, raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, invest in new infrastructure\u2014providing jobs and skills throughout the country\u2014expand Social Security benefits, and make Medicare a national single-payer health insurance system. Add an ambitious plan for climate change\u2014centered on a carbon tax\u2014and new Wall Street regulations meant to stop another financial crisis, and you have a wide agenda for redistribution that rivals Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, Truman\u2019s G.I. Bill, and Johnson\u2019s Great Society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYou can read this as a left-liberal wishlist, but for Sanders and his supporters, it\u2019s much more than that. To them, it is a serious plan to strike a powerful blow to inequality, from the wide gap between rich and poor, to the yawning divide between black and white. \u201cTo be honest with you,\u201d explained Sanders in a June interview on ABC\u2019s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, \u201cgiven the disparity that we\u2019re seeing in income and wealth in this country, it applies even more to the African-American community and to the Hispanic community.\u201d\n\nPartisans for the senator are even more forceful. \u201cClosing the racial wealth gap is probably the single most effective thing that any politician could do to help advance the cause of ending structural racism in America,\u201d writes Hamilton Nolan for Gawker, in praise and defense of Sanders. \u201cThis is because promoting progressive economic policies that work against the extreme concentration of wealth in small groups of people is something that politicians can actually do that has actual real world effects on racial inequality.\u201d\n\nOf course, none of this would address racism, full stop. (And despite his clumsiness with racial conversations, neither Sanders nor his campaign has ever claimed it would.) It wouldn\u2019t end bias in hiring or other forms of employment discrimination, nor would it address concentrated poverty, residential segregation, housing affordability, or the broad problem of police violence. But in a world where the Sanders plan was law, racial minorities\u2014and blacks in particular\u2014would have more and greater opportunity. Couple this with his outline for reducing race discrimination in criminal justice\u2014crafted as a direct result of protests from Black Lives Matter activists\u2014and Sanders has built an ambitious plan for tackling racial inequality across American society.\n\nBut, for the senator\u2019s supporters and other observers, all of this just raises a question: If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race, then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform?\n\nLast week, for instance, protesters associated with Black Lives Matter interrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle. As with the first interruption, in July, this sparked days of intra-left debate and disagreement. Here\u2019s Nolan, again: \u201cFor those perceptive enough to separate pretty slogans from actual policy prescriptions, it is clear that Bernie Sanders is the candidate most aligned with the group\u2019s values,\u201d he wrote, critiquing the demonstrators. \u201cStifling his voice only helps his opponents.\u201d\n\nOn the other side are writers like New Republic editor Jamil Smith, who are much more sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter activists. \u201cI\u2019m not against criticizing activist tactics,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut the idea that Black Lives Matter protesters are hurting their cause by challenging candidates, even those considered allies, is based in the notion that the burden of making change is on them. It isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem in this debate\u2014and why it\u2019s so frustrating to its participants\u2014is that no one has tried to answer the \u201cwhy\u201d question. Instead, the argument is over tactics, excess, and the prerogatives and responsibilities that come with protesting. Should Black Lives Matter go easy on Sanders? Is the message more important than the particular tactic?\n\nSet those questions aside, however, and you have an easy answer for why Sanders gets the brunt of Black Lives Matter activity, at least among Democratic presidential candidates. Unlike his competitors, Sanders is simply the best available vessel for bringing activists\u2019 concerns to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe picture might be different if Sanders were more marginal and on the periphery of the nomination fight (like former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb). As it stands, the Vermont senator is the leading alternative to frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. He earns almost 20 percent or more in most national polls of the race, and is effectively tied for first in New Hampshire. He also dwarfs any other candidate for president\u2014in either party\u2014in terms of shear crowd size: 27,000 in Los Angeles, 28,000 in Portland, Oregon, and 15,000 in Seattle, where his speech was interrupted last week.\n\nAt the same time, Sanders doesn\u2019t have the tightly closed-down campaign of Hillary Clinton. He is accessible, as evidenced by the ease with which activists have reached him on stage. And while he\u2019s been clumsy in these incidents, he also hasn\u2019t lashed out. In both cases, he ceded the mic. Compare that to the attempted Black Lives Matter protest at a Clinton rally in New Hampshire. Activists reached the event, but they couldn\u2019t get past security to announce their presence.\n\nIn this environment, if you\u2019re trying to make a splash, you go with Sanders, especially when he\u2019s more open to change and adjustment than the alternatives. Disrupting Sanders gives you more bang for your buck: It keeps you in the news and puts indirect pressure on other campaigns that know they\u2019ll have to answer to the movement\u2019s questions. To that point, the New Hampshire demonstrators couldn\u2019t crash the Clinton rally, but they still met with the candidate\u2014quietly\u2014and discussed their concerns. In all likelihood, the pressure on Sanders has forced Clinton\u2014the likely nominee\u2014to devote more time to Black Lives Matter, in a bid to protect her flank. And in turn, this brings their issues up the ladder, closer to the top of the party\u2019s agenda.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf15704235215b082e3b8"}}
