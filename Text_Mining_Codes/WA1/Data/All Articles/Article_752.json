On Friday, the Hollywood Reporter noticed an interesting addition to Amfest\u2019s lineup: I Am Michael, a gay-themed film about a gay rights activist man who tries to become straight.\n\nAmfest\u2019s decision to include the movie is quite notable, since screening it in Russia is almost certainly illegal. Under the country\u2019s \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d law, it is a crime to expose minors to any positive depiction of gay life. Because I Am Michael contains such a depiction, it\u2019s probably criminal to show it in public. Enforcement of the law has been inconsistent when it comes to Western movies\u2014the very gay Pride has been screened without issue\u2014but Amfest\u2019s willingness to show the film is still a bold move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf23504235215b082e447"}}
