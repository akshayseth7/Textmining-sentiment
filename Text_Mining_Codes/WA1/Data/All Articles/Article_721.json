John McCain to a new level. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Trump said of a man who spent more than five years as a prisoner in a North Vietnam war camp. \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nTrump\u2019s dig at McCain, his party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee, drew scattered boos from the near-capacity crowd at the 2,729-seat auditorium on the campus of Iowa State University. His comments came during an exchange with the moderator about whether Trump had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d with some of his remarks during his campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump and McCain have been sniping at each other with increasing frequency of late. The spat began when McCain, a long-time advocate of immigration reform, took issue with the real estate mogul\u2019s remarks branding many Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers. Trump then fired back during a rally in McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona last weekend, calling the Republican senator \u201cweak on immigration\u201d and an \u201cincompetent\u201d politician, and suggesting that a more conservative candidate could defeat McCain during his Republican Senate primary next year. McCain, in turn, returned fire in an interview with the New Yorker on Thursday. \u201cThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cBecause what we did was he fired up the crazies.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019s rivals in the GOP\u2019s crowded presidential field wasted no time rushing to McCain\u2019s defense on Saturday, including Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, and Rick Santorum, who tweeted: \u201c[John McCain] is an American hero, period.\u201d Perry went even further, calling for Trump to drop out as a result. \u201cHis comments have reached a new low in American politics,\u201d the former Texas governor said in a written statement. \u201cHis attack on veterans make him unfit to be Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces, and he should immediately withdraw from the race for President.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, is no stranger to inflammatory rhetoric and hasn\u2019t hesitated to attack his fellow Republicans, including Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who has seen Trump pull even or surpass him in recent national polls. Still, Trump\u2019s latest swing at McCain is a good deal bigger than the ones he\u2019s taken at Bush about his negotiating skills, and touches on a group of Americans\u2014veterans\u2014that tend to be off-limits from political criticism. As a result, his jab at McCain provides an opening for Trump's rivals to criticize him without having to navigate more fraught territory like immigration reform.\n\nAt least one conservative observer was already predicting that Trump\u2019s attack on McCain could derail a campaign that has so far only gotten stronger under the spotlight. \u201cAdvice to [Trump]: Apologize for this pronto,\u201d Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol tweeted. \u201cOtherwise beginning of the end.\u201d Whether that proves true, of course, remains to be seen. To date, Trump\u2019s failure to play by the traditional rules of politics doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt him one bit.\n\nWith the crowd in Ames on Saturday morning, at least, Trump\u2019s brand seemed largely untarnished. After providing rambling answers to a few more questions from the moderator and the crowd\u2014and at one point responding to a question about his Christian faith by mentioning the GDP and his MBA\u2014Trump left to a standing ovation.\n\nUpdate 2:42 p.m.: Trump is already scrambling to clean up his mess without backing off his attacks on McCain. Shortly after leaving the summit, he posted a message to his Facebook account that explained that he is \u201cnot a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans,\u201d and because\u201c\"he was extremely disrespectful\u201d to those Arizona voters he labeled \u201ccrazies.\u201d In closing, Trump praised American troops. \u201cI have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren\u2019t captured and are also heroes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to strengthen our military and take care of our Veterans. I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN especially for those that serve to protect our freedom. I am fighting for our Veterans!\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The Case for Covering Trump: Why the media shouldn\u2019t ignore his doomed campaign.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21204235215b082e428"}}
