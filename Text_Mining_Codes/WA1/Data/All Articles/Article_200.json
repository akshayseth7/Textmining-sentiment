{"URL": "https://www.trustedsec.com/august-2015/second-larger-ashley-madison-dump-released/", "Text": "A second \u2013 larger dump containing multiple files roughly around 19gigs was just released on TOP of the original dump two days ago with the Ashley Madison hack. It looks like it was in response to Avid Life (owner of Ashley Madison) response that the dump was not legitimate and fake. The Impact Team hackers posted their message to the CEO of Avid \u2013 Noel Biderman letting him and everyone know that the dump is legitimate and that there\u2019s no question about it now.\n\nThe dump appears to contain all of the CEO \u2013 Noel\u2019s business/corporate emails, source code for all of their websites, mobile applications, and more. Note that we do not plan on performing analysis on the actual files due to the sensitivity of the dump however, it does appear to be legitimate like the other dump.\n\nInteresting enough \u2013 if this turns out to be legitimate which it in all aspects appears to be \u2013 having full source code to these websites means that other hacker groups now have the ability to find new flaws in Avid Life\u2019s websites, and further compromise them more.\n\nIf there was any question to the validity of the data before \u2013 those should be removed now.\n\nThanks to the TrustedSec team \u2013 Justin Elze, Martin Bos, Doug HiWiller, and Dave Kennedy.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef0004235215b082e21e"}}
