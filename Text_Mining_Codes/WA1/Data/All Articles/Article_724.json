(Brian McNoldy)\n\nThis 165 reading, recorded at 4:30 p.m. local time Friday, comes one day after the heat index soared to 159 degrees (70 Celsius) in the same location.\n\n[Unbearable heat and humidity in Iran city were \u2018completely normal\u2019 says local]\n\nBandar Mahshahr sits adjacent to the Persian Gulf in southwest Iran where water temperatures are in the 90s. Such high temperatures lead to some of the most oppressive humidity levels in the world when winds blow off the sweltry water.\n\n\n\nLocation of Bandar Mahshahr, Iran portrayed by red marker. (Google map)\n\nIn southeast Iran, also along the Persian Gulf, Jask, Iran observed a heat index of 156 degrees (69 Celsius) on Friday (air temperature 102.2 degrees with a dew point of 91.4 degrees).\n\n[Seattle just broke TWO incredible records \u2014 hot and dry]\n\nAlthough there are no official records, 178 degrees (81 Celsius) is the highest known heat index ever attained. It was observed in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on July 8, 2003. In his book Extreme Weather, weather historian Christopher Burt says Dhahran, also on the Persian Gulf, registered an air temperature of 108 degrees (42 Celsius) and a dew point of 95 (35 Celsius), which computes to such an extreme heat index level.\n\nThis week\u2019s extreme heat index values have occurred as a punishing heat wave has engulfed the Middle East.\n\n50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) + stations Thursday: ORMM (Bashrah Iraq) 51\u00b0C KQTZ (Baghdad Iraq) 50\u00b0C pic.twitter.com/MQZCLSj79I \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) July 30, 2015\n\nOn Thursday, Baghdad soared to 122 degrees (50C) \u2013 though its dew point was a lowly 44 (7 Celsius) given its desert environs. That combination produced a heat index of 115 \u2013 the dry air taking a slight edge off the blistering temperatures.\n\n1 of 6 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Some of the hottest places on Earth View Photos It feels like it couldn\u2019t be any hotter than it is in D.C., but believe it or not, there are worse places to be. Caption It feels like it couldn\u2019t be any hotter than it is in D.C., but believe it or not, there are worse places to be. Lut desert, or Dasht-e Lut, is a large salt desert in southeastern Iran and is the world's 25th-largest desert. In 2004 and 2005, NASA mapped the soil surface temperature of Earth and found that Lut desert was the hottest, with soil temperatures reaching about 160 degrees.

Iraq declared a 4-day heat holiday for temps over 120 degrees]\n\nThe extreme heat over such a long duration is particularly taxing in this war-ravaged region, as Weather.com explains:\n\nThe government has urged residents to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water, but for many of the more than 3 million Iraqis displaced by violent conflict, that poses a dilemma. Chronic electricity and water cuts in Iraq and other conflict-ridden countries make heat waves like the present one even more unbearable \u2013 particularly for the more than 14 million people displaced by violence across the region. In the southern Iraqi city of Basrah earlier this month, protesters clashed with police as they demonstrated for better power services, leaving one person dead. Unlike other countries in the region, Iraq lacks beaches and travel restrictions make it difficult for people to escape the sweltering heat, leaving many \u2013 even those fortunate enough to live in their homes \u2013 with limited options for cooling off. Some swim in rivers and irrigation canals, while others spend these days in air-conditioned shopping malls.\n\nNotes: Credit to AccuWeather\u2019s Anthony Sagliani for posting Iran temperature information on Twitter Thursday.
