He would often ride his bicycle down Yangon\u2019s Bogyoke Aung San Street past the Waziya Cinema and stop to take a look. As he learned more about the theater, he saw how changes in the Myanmarese film industry reflected changes in the country.\n\nThe Waziya is a rarity in the historic Myanmarese neighborhood\u2014it\u2019s the only remaining cinema on a strip once known as \u201cCinema Row.\u201d In an attempt to modernize, the five other pre\u2013World War II theaters that once lined the street have been replaced with high rises, shopping malls, condominiums, and hotels.\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the film industry in Myanmar was one of the most successful and prolific in the region, and there were more than 300 theaters showing local films. When the government took control in 1968, the number of theaters sharply declined, and the quality of films suffered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat interests me about the industry is that it has a long, rich, varied, but also a troubled history, with all the tumultuous political and social changes that have taken place. It is a film history that not many people today are aware of and once I began to research more about it, I became immediately fascinated by it. I felt that by documenting a fragment of this heritage, I would somehow be able to open a small window into the world of this once great and vibrant industry,\u201d he said via email.\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nStephen Kelly\n\nKelly visited the Waziya almost every day from October 2014 to February 2015 for his series, \u201cAs the Lights Fade I.\u201d Sometimes he\u2019d stay for one or two hours; sometimes he\u2019d stay all day. There were four screenings daily\u2014horror, dramas, and comedy films were the most common\u2014and the most popular were the first two of the day. On most days the theater was relatively quiet and he could wait for hours without making a photo. He spent most of his time in the hot and dusty projection room with a small team of projectionists, drinking coffee and watching films.\n\nThe Waziya temporarily shut its doors this year after the lease on the building expired. Currently, the Myanmar Motion Picture Association and the Yangon Heritage Trust are working to turn it into a modern cinema and performing arts space. As the country moves further from its authoritarian past, Kelly thinks the industry can recover and the Waziya will thrive once again.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be hope for the future, as censorship has eased and the ability to express oneself more freely is returning to a certain extent. A sense of being cut off from the outside world is also diminishing and access to the Internet is proving to be pivotal in influencing and inspiring the next generation of Burmese filmmakers.\u201d*\n\n\n\nCorrection, Aug. 21, 2015: This post originally misquoted Stephen Kelly as saying \u201cMyanmarian filmmakers.\u201d He referred to the filmmakers as \u201cBurmese.\u201d\n\nStephen Kelly", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c004235215b082e465"}}
