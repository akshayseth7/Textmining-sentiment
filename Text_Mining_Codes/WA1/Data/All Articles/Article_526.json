It wasn\u2019t a good one. She says she made the decision simply because she didn\u2019t want to carry around two phones.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nI am, to put it mildly, skeptical of that answer, given that not wanting two phones conveniently gave Clinton\u2014a public official known to prize her privacy (or secrecy)\u2014unprecedented control over her government records. But there\u2019s another reason to doubt Clinton\u2019s defense, and the Internet quickly provided it in the immediate aftermath of her press conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn a video clip from a Silicon Valley event last month, Clinton was asked whether she preferred an iPhone or an Android smartphone. \u201ciPhone,\u201d she responded, before adding, \u201cin full disclosure, and a Blackberry.\u201d The footage was first surfaced by American Rising, a Republican PAC that specializes in uncovering exactly this type of thing.\n\nThe clip itself is only 18 seconds long but, according to the Washington Examiner, the full quote doesn\u2019t exactly help her case. \u201cThere are reasons when you start out in Washington on a Blackberry you stay on it in many instances. But it's also \u2014 I don't know, I don't throw anything away. I'm like two steps short of a hoarder. So I have an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone and a Blackberry.\"\n\nExhibit B in the case against convenience comes via a social media townhall event that Clinton hosted in the Philippines in 2011, when she was still secretary of state. Clinton was asked \u201cwhat\u2019s inside your purse\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s on your iPod or iPad?\u201d Here is her full answer, according to State Department transcripts:\n\nWell, I have a quite large purse, because when you travel as much as I do, you never know what you\u2019re going to need. So in addition to makeup and all that goes with that, usually my Blackberry and papers of all kinds, because I can\u2019t get away with a small purse because I\u2019m in and out of meetings all the time. So it\u2019s kind of a purse/briefcase sort of operation going on here. But when I go overseas, like on this trip, there are many more bags that come with me than just my purse in case something else is needed. And my iPod, just the usual wonderful musical \u201cinterluding\u201d diversions that we all need, a wide variety. And on my iPad, I have to confess, mostly news sites, because I do a lot of looking to see what\u2019s going on around the world.\n\nClearly, neither of those remarks supports the idea that Clinton prefers to travel light, and both only add to my skepticism about her professed love of convenience. (An iPad and an iPad mini?!?) Still, I\u2019m not sure either comment is quite the smoking gun people are looking for.\n\nIf you are inclined to think Clinton isn\u2019t telling the truth, then you probably think there was room in that purse for a government smartphone. I certainly do. But if you buy her defense, than you could just as easily make the argument that, given everything Clinton was carrying, the last thing she needed was to have to dig around for multiple phones.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0d704235215b082e365"}}
