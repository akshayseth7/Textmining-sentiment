Ted Cruz and actress Ellen Page, of \u201cJuno\u201d fame, got into a testy and free-wheeling discussion Friday over gay rights here at the Iowa State Fair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to answer your question but not to have a back-and-forth debate,\u201d Cruz told Page, as she pressed him about discrimination against LGBT citizens, approaching him as he flipped pork chops over an open grill. But the two then proceeded to have a spirited exchange over gay rights and whether private businesses \u2014 florist companies, for example \u2014can refuse to cater gay weddings in the name of their religious beliefs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discussion, which was held in view of reporters and caught on video for Page\u2019s new Vice show, came hours before Cruz hosts a religious liberty rally here in Des Moines, where he will be defending what he sees as that right.\n\n\u201cImagine, hypothetically, you had a gay florist and imagine two evangelical Christians wanted to get married and the gay florist decided, \u2018You know what, I disagree with your faith, I don\u2019t want to provide flowers,\u2019\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI would say they should provide the flowers,\u201d said Page, who earlier charged Cruz\u2019s argument was the same used to justify segregation.\n\n\u201cAnd I would say the gay florist has every right to say, if I disagree with your faith and don\u2019t want to participate\u2026you know what? There are lots of other people to buy flowers from,\u201d Cruz said. \u201c\u2026We are a country that respects pluralism and diversity and there is this liberal intolerance that says that anyone that dares follow a Biblical teaching of marriage, that is the union of one man and one woman must be persecuted, must be fined and must be driven out of business.\u201d\n\nThe senator went on to say that the much bigger challenge for gay people comes from the Middle East, where they are deeply persecuted by the Iranian government as well as the leadership of ISIS.\n\n\u201cOn the left you hear complete silence\u201d \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Page interjected\u2014 \u201cabout Iran hanging homosexuals, and yet the Obama administration is sending over $100 billion to a regime that murders homosexuals,\u201d Cruz continued.\n\nPage noted that she finds that problematic, but says there is persecution everywhere, even if not to the same extent as in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cDoes that trouble you at all, that you draw a moral equivalence between Christians in Jamaica and radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS that are beheading children?\u201d Cruz demanded. \u201c\u2026They\u2019re not morally equivalent. Murder is murder is murder, and it is wrong, and it is wrong across the board.\u201d\n\nPage attended as part of her new show with Vice, called \u201cGaycation,\u201d where she travels around the world and explores local attitudes about LGBT culture in each place. Page came out as gay last year.\n\n\u201cWhy does the Obama administration not stand against this?\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019d love to talk to Obama about it,\u201d Page replied\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re agreed!\u201d Cruz shot back,\n\n\u201cNo, no we\u2019re not, don\u2019t do that,\u201d the actress said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re agreed! Ma\u2019am, we\u2019ve had a long discussion,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cYeah, I appreciate it, yeah,\u201d she said sarcastically, and walked away.\n\nHadas Gold contributed to this report.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf11704235215b082e3a4"}}
