Its 64 mansions will have cellars stocked with first-growth Bordeaux, gold-plated shower heads and commanding views of emerald polo grounds, Pan says.\n\nAnchored by the Tianjin Goldin Metropolitan Polo Club, the villas are part of a $5 billion, 89-hectare (220-acre) development that\u2019s expected to include a 117-story office tower that has risen to almost half its planned height, an upscale shopping mall, a Las Vegas\u2013style theater, a convention center and dozens of apartment blocks, four of which are nearly sold out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with three Michelin stars or Robert Parker\u2019s 100 points,\u201d Pan says. \u201cWe want to put everything that is high-end into one community, where horses are front and center.\u201d China is minting more millionaires than any other emerging economy, according to the 2013 Asia-Pacific Wealth Report from Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management, which puts their ranks at 643,000, up 14.3 percent from 2012.\n\nTurnkey Sophistication\n\nProperty developers in China have been building pricey villas overlooking golf courses for decades; now, by replacing fairways with the Kentucky bluegrass of polo fields, Pan is introducing the country\u2019s nouveaux riches to a whole new level of turnkey sophistication.\n\n\u201cHe has a certain savoir-faire that differentiates him from people who have only money,\u201d says Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. \u201cHe wants to create an experience that is not only a property but a lifestyle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lifestyle that\u2019s part Donald Trump, part British aristocracy. Pan\u2019s Gulfstream G550 jets him to homes in Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles and Tianjin, where he\u2019s building a 6,500-square-meter (70,000-square-foot) mansion that\u2019s bigger than Candyland, the late Aaron Spelling\u2019s former 5,100-square-meter house in L.A. And he hobnobs with princes Harry and William at a charity polo match he sponsors at England\u2019s exclusive Beaufort Polo Club each June.\n\nPolo Club\n\nThe furnishings headed for his Tianjin manse may be faux Louis XV, but the polo club it overlooks is the real deal. \u201cThe general facilities are outstanding, and not many sporting clubs in the world are more elegant,\u201d Richard Caleel, president of the Federation of International Polo said by telephone from Santa Barbara, California.\n\nIt\u2019s stocked with more than 200 top-of-the-line ponies from Argentina and Australia, and each January, the club stages the Snow Polo World Cup, which fields top international teams. At last year\u2019s event, Pan flew in opera singers from Buenos Aires, offered a course called \u201cDeconstructing Molecular Gastronomy\u201d and treated guests to a tasting of wines from Chateau Haut-Brion, one of only five Bordeaux estates with the top premier cru classification.\n\nPan, 51, never even made it past high school. Born in Shaoguan, in Guangdong province, he was brought up by his paternal grandmother in Guangzhou until her death from cancer when he was 13, at which point he moved to San Marino, California, to live with his stepgrandmother.\n\nSkipping School\n\nHe spent most of his time skipping school and hanging out in the family\u2019s chain of Chinese restaurants, so he never learned to speak much English. After five years, he moved to Hong Kong and, with a loan from his family, set up a business dealing in Japanese electronics.\n\nTen years later, he moved into manufacturing in southern China, eventually commanding 90 percent of China\u2019s production of karaoke monitors through his Matsunichi Communication Holdings Ltd. In 2002, Pan listed the company (since renamed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd.) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nFive years later, he branched out into real estate when he acquired the Tianjin parcel. As of mid-March, his controlling stakes in Goldin Properties and its sister company, Goldin Financial Holdings Ltd., were worth some $2.8 billion.\n\nFirst Winery\n\nThree years ago, Pan bought his first winery, paying $50 million for Sloan Estate, a Rutherford, California, producer of Bordeaux-style reds whose most recent vintage, the 2009, sells for $367 a bottle.\n\nLast April, Pan snapped up Chateau Le Bon Pasteur from one of Bordeaux\u2019s foremost winemaking families, along with Chateau Rolland-Maillet in St.-Emilion and Chateau Bertineau St.-Vincent in Lalande de Pomerol.\n\nMore acquisitions are planned. \u201cWe are aggressively still in investment mode,\u201d says Jenny Pan, his 26-year-old daughter, who took over the running of Sloan after a two-year stint working in wealth management at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York. \u201cThe Bordeaux and Sloan vineyards are only the first few in a hundred-step journey to build up our business.\u201d\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on corruption enters its second year, conspicuous consumption of Patek Philippe watches and Louis Vuitton handbags is still frowned upon, something that makes Pan\u2019s offering of a discreet lifestyle behind closed doors appealing.\n\n\u2018Less Ostentatious\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople are moving towards a less ostentatious display of wealth,\u201d says Michael Klibaner, regional head of research at real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. in Hong Kong.\n\nThough Klibaner finds the idea of a polo club \u201ca bit gimmicky,\u201d he says it\u2019s a smart alternative at a time when China has imposed a ban on building any more golf courses.\n\nWilliam Lin, a Tianjin-based Internet entrepreneur and the first Chinese member to take up polo at the club, says the limited popularity of the game isn\u2019t the point.\n\n\u201cMost people who buy apartments here won\u2019t play but will like a lifestyle where they can watch out the window,\u201d he says. \u201cAs the Chinese make more money, they will need to know which kind of high-class lifestyle they should follow.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Frederik Balfour in Hong Kong at fbalfour@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ted Moncreiff at tmoncreiff@bloomberg.net Andreea Papuc, Joel Weber", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf07104235215b082e2f8"}}
