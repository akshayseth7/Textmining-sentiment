Ultimately, the event was held in Mobile's Ladd-Peebles Stadium, which can hold up to 40,000 people.\n\nThe stadium was about half full when Trump started his speech. He said it drew 30,000 people.\n\nAlabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks was largest crowd of political season. Nice! \u2014 Donald J.

The hotel was great. They said something is happening here. We can't hold this,\" Trump said. \"And then, we want to the convention center and they can have 10,000 people...The next day they said too many people we can't put them in. So we came here.\"\n\nTrump supporters begin to line up in Mobile for what the campaign hopes is the biggest rally of the 2016 race so far pic.twitter.com/9WJnvXnskR \u2014 Seni Tienabeso (@SeniABC) August 21, 2015\n\nLiterally thousands here already!

And you can do something fast. You can do something fast. So we have 300,000 babies a year. 300,000 that you have to take care of. We all have to take care of. And you know, in the case of other countries, including Mexico, they don't do that. It doesn't work that way.\"\n\nChristopher Donato contributed reporting.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee0f04235215b082e167"}}
