Photos courtesy of Durham Police Department and Durham County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2012, in Durham, North Carolina, police officer Kelly Stewart pulled over Carlos Antonio Riley for a routine traffic stop. What happened next is a matter of intense dispute. Riley, who is black, says the officer racially profiled him then attacked him. Stewart, who is also black, says Riley engaged him in a violent, physical struggle. The encounter ended when Stewart accidentally shot himself in the leg with his firearm. Soon after, the police department logged the gun\u2019s discharge: \u201c1 shot fired by officer.\u201d\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nDistrict Attorney Roger Echols, working closely with the police department, then launched a criminal case against Riley\u2014claiming that Riley shot Stewart with Stewart\u2019s gun. The DA kept mounds of evidence away from the jury that proved Stewart shot himself. And he pressed his case against Riley all the way to trial, where Stewart testified, under oath, that he did not shoot his gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a jury acquitted Riley of shooting Stewart, bringing a just end to a deeply troubling story. During the trial, defense attorney Alex Charns repeatedly described the prosecution\u2019s strategy as \u201ca shell game, a cover up, and a railroad.\u201d Examining the evidence, it is nearly impossible to come to any other conclusion.\n\nFrom the start, Stewart\u2019s attempt to detain Riley looked like bad policing. Stewart was driving an unmarked vehicle and dressed in plainclothes when he pulled Riley over\u2014for \u201cfishtailing\u201d down the road, he alleges. Riley says he was pulled over for driving while black. Stewart claims the car slid forward during the stop, and he dove in to grab the emergency brake. Riley claims the officer pulled out his gun and screamed, \u201cGet back, I\u2019m gonna fucking shoot you!\u201d At one point, Stewart claimed he was standing outside the car during the fight. Later, he claimed Riley wrestled him onto his back in the passenger seat then climbed on top of him.\n\nBoth men agree about what happened at the end of the encounter: One bullet was fired from Stewart\u2019s gun into Stewart\u2019s leg. The officer made a quick recovery. Riley was sent to prison.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the police department decided to assert that Riley shot Stewart, bringing in the DA to prosecute what had theretofore been treated as an accident. But it certainly didn\u2019t happen immediately. Ninety-five minutes after the shooting, an official at the department filled out a gunshot residue analysis information form, which plainly declared that the officer\u2014not the suspect\u2014fired the shot. On the day of the shooting, Stewart appears to have acknowledged that he fired his own gun.\n\nDocument via Durham Police Department\n\nBut by the time the case went to trial, Stewart\u2019s story had changed, and no officers came forward to contradict it. Now Stewart alleged that his finger was off the trigger when the gun went off. In his new memory of the altercation, Stewart testified that Riley brutally beat him after he pulled the car\u2019s emergency brake. (An emergency medical services witness said Stewart had no injuries that would indicate a physical assault\u2014no bruising, cuts, or blood.) Stewart alleged that Riley then grasped the muzzle of his gun, turned it toward the officer, and fired it.\n\nStewart alleges that he jumped into the tiny Nissan face-first and somehow wound up on his back in the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\nIf that were true, Riley\u2019s hand would have burns from grasping the hot muzzle of a smoking gun. Riley had no such burns.\n\nStewart\u2019s story had other problems. The officer claimed he pulled over Riley for swerving excessively\u2014yet, oddly, he declined to call the stop in to police communications, in violation of department policy. (Charns speculates that Stewart did not want to boost his traffic-stop statistics for blacks, which were already uncomfortably high.) Stewart also said he had to dive into Riley\u2019s car to pull the emergency brake\u2014but the brake\u2019s handle is quite large and seemingly accessible from outside the driver\u2019s door. Finally, Stewart claims Riley savagely pinned him down on his back in the passenger seat. This, however, is physically improbable. Riley\u2019s Nissan is tiny, with minimal room to maneuver. Stewart alleges that he jumped into the car face-first, somehow wound up on his back in the passenger\u2019s seat seconds later. Charns told jurors that Stewart would have to be a \u201cshape shifter\u201d to accomplish this feat.\n\nThe prosecution kept all inconvenient evidence\u2014including the critical gunshot report\u2014out of the trial. That strategy forced the defense to make a tough decision. Under North Carolina law, the defense is allowed to make the first and last closing arguments. But it loses that right if it introduces its own evidence. Charns weighed the benefit of an impassioned closing argument against the dry but revealing gunshot analysis form. He decided he would rather send the jury into deliberations after hearing his vehement closing plea.\n\nAs Charns prepared for trial, he received an unsettling surprise. Prosecutors asked for an in-chambers, off-the-record meeting\u2014and asked the judge to remove Charns as Riley\u2019s counsel. Charns, they claimed, was insufficiently informed about \u201ccriminal rules and procedures.\u201d This extremely unusual request came as a shock to Charns, a renowned attorney with 32 years of experience who specializes in police misconduct cases and criminal trials. Charns, who was appointed to the case by a public defender specifically because of his stellar qualifications, demanded that the discussion be moved to open court and put on the record. The judge denied the prosecution\u2019s request in open court before the trial began.\n\nRiley was found not guilty of assaulting Stewart by a jury of 10 men and two women. After the jury announced its verdict, Charns asked the judge to sanction the prosecution for its alleged misconduct. The judge denied the request.\n\nDurham Police Chief Jose L. Lopez Sr. released a statement on behalf of the Durham Police Department following Riley\u2019s acquittal, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re disappointed with today\u2019s verdict.\u201d The department also clarified that it \u201chas no further comment on this case.\u201d\n\nAlthough Riley has been acquitted of shooting Stewart, he will not walk free. Because Riley fled the scene with Stewart\u2019s gun, the jury convicted him of robbery. (Riley is appealing this conviction.) Moreover, Riley previously pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon in a separate federal prosecution centered around the same incident. (The firearm he possessed was Stewart\u2019s gun.) For that crime, Riley was sentenced to an unexpectedly severe 10 years in prison\u2014the maximum sentence he could have received for the crime.\n\nShortly after I interviewed Charns, he sent me an email telling me that someone called him, claiming to be Mark Joseph Stern, asking about the Riley case.\n\n\u201cPlease let me know if this was in fact not you who called,\u201d he wrote.\n\nI responded, confirming that it was I who called, but that I understood his concern.\n\n\u201cYou can never be too sure,\u201d I wrote.\n\nHe responded immediately.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef3d04235215b082e254"}}
