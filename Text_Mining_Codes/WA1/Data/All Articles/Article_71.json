The company has not yet commented publicly on the new regulations.\n\n\"To ensure the safety of our guests and employees, backpacks and bags of any kind are subject to inspection prior to admission,\" it continues.\n\nLast week, police were deployed outside the Regal cinema in Los Angeles ahead of the premiere of the film Straight Outta Compton.\n\nTwo weeks before the Nashville attack, two people were shot dead and nine others injured when a man attacked a cinema in Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\nThe change in policy also comes the same month Colorado theatre killer, James Holmes, was given a life sentence for killing 12 people and injuring 70 others at a screening of a Batman film in 2012.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee5204235215b082e19c"}}
