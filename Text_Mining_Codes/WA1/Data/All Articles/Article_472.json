Take care,\u201d Francesco Macri wrote after a patron criticized the sandwiches at his Midtown deli.\n\nThe visitor to Park Italian Gourmet was sharing a meal with a pal and called the hero skimpy, saying it lacked \u201ccomplexity.\u201d The reviewer gave the deli just one star, the lowest rating.\n\nMacri shot back, \u201cI haven\u2019t shared a sandwich with anyone since I was maybe 6 years old.\u201d\n\nMacri told another Yelp reviewer that she was \u201cfull of s\u2013t.\u201d He called one man \u201cproprio scemo\u201d or \u201cjust stupid\u201d in Italian and said to another, \u201cIf you came back, I\u2019d kick you out again.\u201d\n\nMacri stood by his comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a nice person,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nHe said he wanted to \u201cdefend myself and my business from a public complaints department.\u201d\n\nYelp gets 135 million monthly visitors, giving its laptop reviewers of restaurants, hair salons, dry cleaners and even prisons great power.\n\nSome Yelpers have tried to use the threat of bad reviews as extortion \u2014 to get a seat or even discounted food.\n\nIn Boston, one chef recently turned the tables on diners who seated themselves without a reservation, refused to leave and then conspicuously posted to Yelp in order to remain at the eatery. Michael Scelfo put their photo on Instagram with the hashtag WeDoNotNegotiateWithYelpers.\n\nGaia Bagnasacco, the owner of Gaia Italian Cafe on the Lower East Side, also takes a tough stand. She was unapologetic about her blunt rebuttals to unhappy diners.\n\n\u201cWhere are the educated customers? Where are the people who understand quality and what we are doing?\u201d she wrote last month in response to a woman who complained about overcooked pasta and poor service.\n\nSteven Gelfer of Montclair, NJ, complained on Yelp that Bagnasacco threw him and his elderly parents out of the nearly empty restaurant in 2013 when they asked to be seated at a different table.\n\n\u201cYou were not happy so we have invite [sic] you with all our love to find a place where you would be happy,\u201d Bagnasacco countered.\n\nGelfer said he was not feeling the love. \u201cIt was the single worst experience that we\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nBagnasacco, who has owned the eponymous restaurant for five years, told The Post that she replies to those who judge her.\n\n\u201cThey think they know everything about food and running a restaurant,\u201d she fumed.\n\nWhen a diner at Il Triangolo in Queens griped on Yelp about having to hang up his coat, he said he was met with an email from the restaurant owner reading: \u201cPROPER ATTIRE FOR DINNER HOURS AND ALL COATS & JACKETS MUST BE HUNG.\u201d\n\nMario Gigliotti told The Post that the Yelp reviewers were mostly young and not accustomed to his old-school restaurant.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re used to going to these fast-food restaurants . . . like Olive Garden,\u201d Gigliotti said.\n\n\u201cThey complain about the service being slow, stupid stuff like that.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0ac04235215b082e32f"}}
