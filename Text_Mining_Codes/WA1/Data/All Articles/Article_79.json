The idea -- embraced by some individual colleges already -- requires both parties to explicitly consent to sexual acts. Simply not objecting will no longer constitute consent. The new law also requires other steps by colleges to better educate students about consent and sexual assault. Many women's advocates have praised the legislation, while some civil liberties advocates have expressed concern that the law shifts too much of the burden of proof in these cases to the accused.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee5b04235215b082e1a4"}}
