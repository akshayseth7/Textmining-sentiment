Granted, the Westboro Baptist Church hates most people, but since 2011\u2014when the Fighters made a fake gay porno , then countered the church\u2019s Kansas City, Missouri protest by performing \u201cKeep it Clean (Hot Buns)\u201d on a flatbed truck\u2014it\u2019s been locked in an especially funny grudge match with Dave Grohl\u2019s band.\n\nOn Friday night, the church once again picketed the band in Kansas City\u2014until, that is, Grohl and friends drove by in a pickup blaring Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d As Slate editor Gabriel Roth notes, this is not, in the strictest sense, a Rickroll (that would require the good ol\u2019 hyperlink bait-and-switch), but it\u2019s still some ace trolling by the Foo.
