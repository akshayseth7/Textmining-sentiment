She can apply for a special or social visit pass since she is married to a Malaysian,\" he said on Sunday (Aug 23).\n\nAsked if she was still in Malaysia, he declined to comment.\n\nMs Sidhu had lived in Malaysia for more than 20 years before a sudden turn of events, which started with investigations by the authorities on her and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission adviser Rashpal Singh over a purported leak in relation to a charge sheet.\n\nMs Sidhu was head of administration and finance at the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and was attached to a special task force investigating various financial cases.\n\nThe task force was established to probe 1MDB and the RM2.6 billion (S$879 million) channelled into Prime Minister Najib Razak's personal bank accounts.\n\nThe group was disbanded after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nNews of Ms Sidhu's sacking from the AGC created a buzz after sources familiar with her revealed that she had been sacked suddenly.\n\nAttorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali said her work contract had been terminated in accordance with her terms of service.\n\nMs Sidhu and Tan Sri Rashpal were released on police bail after their statements were recorded.\n\nMs Sidhu's bail was reported to have been revoked last week.\n\nOn Thursday night, photos were circulated on the Internet of personnel believed to be from the department, waiting outside a condominium in Bangsar, where Ms Sidhu lived.", "_id": {"$oid": "55dc236904235215b082e4d5"}}
