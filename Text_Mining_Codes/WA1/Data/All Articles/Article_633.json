They include Bernard Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, whiskey heirs Samuel and Edgar Bronfman, gambling mogul Sheldon Adelson, heiress Lynn Schusterman, Wall Street speculators Michael Steinhardt and Paul Singer, and Leonard Abramson, founder of U.S. Healthcare. As Eli Clifton has documented , from 2008 to 2011, the largest contributors were Abramson, Marcus, Adelson, and Singer, and businessman Newton Becker. Some of FDD\u2019s donors, particularly in the organization\u2019s early years, gave to a wide range of groups that back Israel, but some of them, including Marcus, Adelson, Becker, and their foundations, have also contributed to groups like the Zionist Organization of America and Christians United for Israel that are aligned with Israeli right-wing nationalists who favor a \u201cgreater Israel\u201d that includes East Jerusalem and the West Bank settlements. (When I asked May whether he agreed with Adelson\u2019s stands on Iran and Palestinian statehood, he said that Adelson hadn\u2019t contributed to FDD for \u201csome time\u201d and that he was not \u201cup-to-date\u201d on Adelson\u2019s views. Nevertheless, in a July 2012 article in National Review objecting to a New York Times editorial critical of Adelson, May defended the gambling mogul\u2019s rejection of a Palestinian state.)\n\nTo be sure, FDD is no longer a public relations group for Israel. And over the years, it has become much more of a conventional think tank than an advocacy group. But in several important ways, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies seems to have remained an organization dedicated intellectually and politically to the defense of one particular democracy.\n\nFDD\u2019s website says simply that it was founded \u201cto promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism,\u201d but, as the journalist Ali Gharib has noted , it arose out of an organization committed to burnishing Israel\u2019s reputation in the United States. On April 24, 2001, three major pro-Israel donors incorporated an organization called EMET (Hebrew for \u201ctruth\u201d). In an application to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, May explained that the group \u201cwas to provide education to enhance Israel\u2019s image in North America and the public\u2019s understanding of issues affecting Israeli-Arab relations.\u201d But in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, May broadened the group\u2019s mission and changed its name to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As he explained in a supplement to the IRS, the group\u2019s board of directors decided to focus on \u201cdevelop[ing] educational materials on the eradication of terrorism everywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nFDD was the brainchild of a New York Times journalist-turned-Republican operative. Clifford May, who is now 63 worked as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times and an editor of the Rocky Mountain News, but in 1997 became the communications director of the Republican National Committee. In September 2001, having left the RNC, May was recruited to lead a new foreign policy group.* With thick brown hair, a trim, graying beard, and rimless glasses, May looks like an early-20 th -century European intellectual, but he has proved to be a master political entrepreneur in an era of television and social media.\n\nFDD also describes itself as a global research organization. Its purpose, it says, is to conduct \u201cresearch and provide education on international terrorism\u2014the most serious security threat to the United States and other free, democratic nations.\u201d But it has conducted its research from a particular vantage point and with a relatively narrow focus. Its research and advocacy have centered on the Middle East and in particular on conflicts and issues that impinge on Israel. And its positions have closely tracked those of the Likud party and its leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2014not just on the Iran deal, but on the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the desirability of a two-state solution. Understanding the think tank\u2019s ideological affinity with the Israeli government, and the roots of that affinity, helps explain the special role that FDD has played in opposing the Iran deal and may shed light on what FDD hopes to accomplish by derailing President Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy accomplishment.\n\nFDD bills itself as \u201ca non-partisan policy institute\u201d in the tradition of groups like the Council on Foreign Relations. Legally speaking, that\u2019s true. But while FDD once had a few Democrats on its Board of Advisors, and can still find a few Democrats like Menendez who are receptive to its message, it has become a Republican-backed organization that reflects the growing political polarization in Washington.\n\nIn the wake of the agreement\u2019s announcement, FDD experts have appeared on Fox News, CBS, CNN, PBS, and other television outlets at least 35 times to oppose it. FDD\u2019s executive director, Mark Dubowitz, is credited with helping design the sanctions regime that was put in place in 2010 and with helping Sens. Mark Kirk and Robert Menendez craft a bill that they introduced in December 2013 that would have set conditions on a final agreement that Iran would have been sure to reject.\n\nDuring the last 18 months, FDD\u2019s experts have testified 17 times before Congress in opposition to the interim and now final agreement. By contrast, experts from the Heritage Foundation, whose budget\u2014$113 million in 2013\u2014is more than 15 times the size of FDD\u2019s, and which also opposes the agreement, have not appeared at all. Critics of the agreement from the American Enterprise Institute, whose budget is more than eight times as large, have testified only once. Of the four witnesses that the Senate Banking Committee called to testify on Aug. 5 on a panel on sanctions against Iran, two were FDD experts, and a third was on the FDD Board of Advisors.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. Opponents of the deal, if they are to carry the day, need crisp talking points and plausible arguments; they need credible experts who will back up their position in congressional hearings, on opinion pages, and on TV and radio. And no organization has been better at providing this kind of intellectual firepower than the little-known Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a relatively small Washington think tank that is devoting itself to defeating the Iran deal.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the so-called 800-pound gorilla , is the big player in lobbying against the nuclear weapons agreement that the United States and five other countries signed with Iran. When it comes to influencing members of Congress, AIPAC has the access to financial contributors with which to reward the compliant and pressure the recalcitrant.\n\nMay always avoided calling for war against Iran except as a last resort, but in 2008, he welcomed former CIA case officer Reuel Marc Gerecht and Iran expert Michael Ledeen (who was a bit player in the Israeli part of the Iran-Contra scandal) to FDD from the American Enterprise Institute.* Gerecht had already been calling for a pre-emptive military strike against Iran. At a Bloomberg conference in 2010, Gerecht would joke that he had \u201ccounted up the other day: I\u2019ve written about 25,000 words about bombing Iran. Even my mom thinks I\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d\n\nAfter Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s announcement in February 2006 that Iran was resuming enriching uranium, FDD and May began focusing on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. May accepted the Israeli government\u2019s argument that an Iranian nuclear weapon posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Israel. He described Iran\u2019s goal as \u201ca Middle East without Jews,\u201d and insisted that Iran posed a direct threat to the United States. \u201cAhmadinejad\u2019s genocidal threats against Israel have been well-publicized,\u201d he wrote , \u201cbut from time to time, he also likes to remind his followers that \u2018a world without America \u2026 is attainable.\u2019\u201d (May\u2019s elision, not mine.)\n\nMay and FDD have been calling for action against Iran since the organization\u2019s founding. And in doing so, they have almost invariably cited Israel\u2019s security. In April 2002 in USA Today, May argued that Israel\u2019s enemies are the same ones as the \u201csuicidal/homicidal terrorists\u201d who view Americans as \u201chated infidels,\u201d and he linked them in turn to \u201cIran and Iraq,\u201d which he described as \u201cterrorist-sponsoring regimes attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction.\u201d The next spring, in the wake of the invasion of Iraq, May suggested that Iranian dissidents could play a similar role to that of the Iraqi dissidents whom the United States was attempting to install in power.\n\nThose FDD donors who were dependable Democrats seem also to have dropped out. Indeed there is now a clear match between the FDD\u2019s contributors and former and existing board members of the increasingly powerful Republican Jewish Coalition, to which May himself was an adviser in the early 2000s. They include Adelson, Marcus, Abramson, Singer, David Epstein, Larry A. Mizel, and Sam Fox. The two organizations have worked in tandem to attempt to defeat the Obama administration\u2019s agreement with Iran.\n\nFDD lost its Democratic board members in 2008. That February it spun off an advocacy organization, the Defense of Democracies, which, according to National Journal, was seeded by a $2 million grant from Adelson. The new group began running ads against Democrats who opposed an intelligence surveillance bill favored by the Bush administration. In response, Brazile, Schumer, Engel, and Marshall quit.\n\nIn its first years, FDD had ties to Democrats. Former Al Gore for President campaign manager Donna Brazile, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, and Reps. Eliot Engel and Jim Marshall were on FDD\u2019s board; and a few initial funders like the Israeli American Haim Saban were associated with the Democratic Party. But over the years, FDD has become an almost entirely Republican-backed organization.\n\nMay doesn\u2019t go out of his way to highlight FDD\u2019s origin as a promoter of Israel and its connections to Washington\u2019s pro-Israel lobby. When I asked him about the group\u2019s emergence from a \u201cpro-Israel organization,\u201d he made no mention of its initial incarnation as EMET. He wrote back, \u201cI was recruited to found FDD after 9/11/01 by Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick whom I knew from my New York Times reporting days. FDD was conceived as a policy institute focusing on national security\u2014of the US and other democratic societies.\u201d The group also omits Dershowitz\u2019s experience at AIPAC from her online bio, writing that she worked for \u201ca leading foreign policy organization for 14 years.\u201d But when I asked May whether the organization\u2019s defense of democracies really boiled down to a defense of the United States and Israel, he did write back, \u201cIsrael, it seemed to me then and seems to me now, is the world\u2019s most endangered democratic society. Those whose mission is \u2018Death to America\u2019 also vow \u2018Death to Israel.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMay himself has adhered more closely to Netanyahu\u2019s position of giving lip service to a two-state solution while maintaining that because of Palestinian refusal to recognize the state of Israel, the conditions do not exist for realizing it. In August 2009, May criticized the Obama administration for pressing Netanyahu to begin talks with the Palestinians and recommended instead Netanyahu\u2019s option of economic development for the West Bank. In his writing, May consistently puts quotes around the adjective occupied for the Palestinian territories that Israel has under military rule. When I asked May why, he replied, \u201cThe West Bank, seized from Jordan after Jordan attacked Israel in 1967, should more accurately be called disputed territories.\u201d\n\nIn their writings, FDD experts have endorsed a view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is in accord with, or sometimes even to the right of, the views of Netanyahu and the Likud party. In November 2007, FDD Senior Fellow Andrew McCarthy wrote in National Review that the Bush administration, in trying to forge a two-state solution, was \u201chellbent on granting statehood to savages who worship \u2018martyrdom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSince its founding, FDD has been running tours of Israel for American academics (with most of their expenses paid) similar to those run for journalists and politicians by AIPAC and other groups. University of Kentucky political scientist Robert Farley, who went on an FDD tour in 2008, says \u201cthe goal of the trip was to inculcate a particular view of the Israeli security situation and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d FDD\u2019s view, Farley says, was \u201cright-wing Likudnik on the relations between Israel and its neighbors and with the Palestinians.\u201d The tour leaders took a \u201cnegative\u201d view of Palestinian statehood. \u201cIt was understood that the military occupation of the West Bank was necessary to prevent a terrorist campaign against Israel.\u201d\n\nMuch of FDD\u2019s key staff was drawn from people who have focused their work on defending Israel from its critics. May\u2019s second in command in FDD\u2019s early years was the Israeli Nir Boms, who had worked for the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Toby Dershowitz, who spent 14 years as AIPAC\u2019s communications head, has handled communications for FDD. Dershowitz\u2019s public relations organization, the Dershowitz Group, is housed in the same downtown M Street location as FDD, and Dershowitz is now listed as the group\u2019s vice president for government relations and strategy. Jonathan Schanzer, FDD\u2019s vice president for research, worked earlier at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which was spun off from AIPAC decades ago as a research organization not subject to the tax restrictions on groups that lobby.\n\nAfter Obama took office, FDD, led by Dubowitz, proposed imposing further sanctions on Iran to force it to abandon its nuclear program. But Dubowitz himself was skeptical about whether sanctions would actually lead to a diplomatic solution. In April 2011, after new sanctions had been imposed, he told Israel\u2019s Ynetnews that \u201cthe sanctions are working by putting pressure on the regime, although they have not secured their objective and may never do so\u2014putting an end to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The best way is to work towards changing the regime. Any deal cut with this regime will be violated.\u201d When Hassan Rouhani, widely considered a moderate on Iran\u2019s political spectrum, was elected Iran\u2019s president in June of 2013, Dubowitz wrote that \u201cthe election of Rouhani, a loyalist of Iran\u2019s supreme leader and a master of nuclear deceit, doesn\u2019t get us any closer to stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear drive.\u201d In August 2013 he warned that Rouhani\u2019s \u201cstatements reveal a conspiratorial, anti-American, and anti-Israeli worldview.\u201d\n\nDubowitz rejected the interim agreement that the United States and five other countries reached with Iran in November 2013, under which Iran temporarily restricted its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of some sanctions. He worked with Kirk and Menendez to devise new legislation that would have required Iran to dismantle all nuclear energy facilities and to stop any aid to Hezbollah and other allies in the region. The legislation also promised that the United States would \u201cstand with Israel\u201d if it went to war with Iran.\n\nClifford May doesn\u2019t go out of his way to highlight FDD\u2019s origin as a promoter of Israel and its connections to D.C.\u2019s pro-Israel lobby.\n\nIn the days before the final agreement with Iran was signed on July 14, FDD took to the hustings, but it didn\u2019t speak with a single voice. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Gerecht and Dubowitz declared their skepticism about the agreement, but the piece reflected Gerecht\u2019s more extreme, and highly original, views on American foreign policy and Iran. Gerecht and Dubowitz argued the dominant Republican strategy of upping sanctions and threatening military force would be \u201cunlikely to thwart the mullahs\u2019 nuclear designs.\u201d The only way to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons was through a military strike, but a military strike could be justified only if Iran were to violate the agreement it had made. \u201cNo American president would destroy Iranian nuclear sites without first exhausting diplomacy,\u201d they wrote. Therefore, the best chance to stop Iran would be to let the agreement go through and wait for Iran to violate it, which, according to Gerecht and Dubowitz, it inevitably would. The \u201chawks who believe that airstrikes are the only possible option for stopping an Iranian nuke should welcome a deal perhaps more than anyone,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is because the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is tailor-made to set Washington on a collision course with Tehran.\u201d In other words, the point of supporting a diplomatic solution was so that it would pave the way for a military strike.\n\nBut in his congressional testimony, Dubowitz took a more conventional tack. He denounced the agreement for providing \u201cIran with a patient path to a nuclear weapon\u201d and called for amending it with new, tougher conditions. May, too, opposed the agreement and said Obama should demand more concessions from Iran.\n\nGerecht and Dubowitz\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed had the virtue of being logical, even if its logic led to war. But the call by May and Dubowitz to reopen negotiations and demand a much tougher agreement made less sense. Dubowitz\u2019s proposed amendments to the deal\u2014which went beyond Iran\u2019s nuclear policy and into its human rights policy and foreign policy\u2014were sure to be rejected by Iran, and probably by other signatories to the deal. And, anyway, Obama, in the last year of his presidency, would be in no position to renegotiate the agreement, even in the highly unlikely event that all five of his negotiating partners, including Russia and China, would be willing to join him in doing so.\n\nThese kinds of considerations have led some supporters of the agreement to argue that hawks like May and Dubowitz, in advocating renegotiation, know that this path will bear no fruit and secretly want to hasten war with Iran. But according to Gerecht, what his colleagues really hope for is that one of the Republicans adamantly opposed to the deal will be elected president in November 2016 and will propose even tougher sanctions and successfully pressure Europe, if not China and Russia, to go along. That scenario seems equally far-fetched, resting on an assumption of America\u2019s powers of persuasion in Europe\u2014which were not evident in the crisis in Syria in 2013\u2014and what is at best a 50\u201350 political calculation about who will be the next president.\n\nWhat may explain why May and Dubowitz seem content with killing the agreement\u2014even if that means damaging U.S. relations with other signatories, getting no agreement whatsoever that Iran will forgo a nuclear weapon, and risking greater war in the region\u2014is a concern that began to surface in May\u2019s columns earlier this year. May described sympathetically Israel\u2019s \u201cworry that Mr. Obama means to form a de facto alliance with Iran.\u201d Some observers have long said that this concern actually lies at the heart of the Israeli government\u2019s opposition to a deal with Iran: Netanyahu fears that a deal would wed American foreign policy to an irredeemably revolutionary Iran at the expense of Israel. And one person familiar with the thinking of FDD experts described this scenario, involving an attempted rapprochement between the United States and Iran, as representing to them \u201cthe worst of all possible worlds.\u201d A veto-proof congressional rejection of the agreement would certainly rule out such rapprochement.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say for sure what FDD ultimately hopes to accomplish with its campaign against the agreement, in part because its experts have not been entirely candid in their arguments. After long invoking the existential threat that an agreement would pose to Israel, May, Dubowitz, and other FDD experts have had little to say about threats to Israel since the agreement was signed. When Dubowitz made a long opening statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 29 and when he and FDD\u2019s Juan Zarate issued statements before the Senate Banking Committee on Aug. 5, they mentioned the deal\u2019s effect on Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, but did not discuss directly what it would mean for Israel. The noun Israel did not appear except in the title of an article in the footnotes to Dubowitz\u2019s statements. May mentioned Israel only once in the three Washington Times columns he wrote opposing the agreement\u2014to warn of how Iran\u2019s \u201chegemonic ambitions\u201d would threaten Israel and the Gulf states. In a column in National Review responding to Obama\u2019s speech at American University, May and Schanzer described the deal\u2019s threat to Americans, but not to Israelis. \u201cIran\u2019s rulers,\u201d they wrote, \u201chave caused thousands of Americans to be killed and maimed in Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan. They continue to openly proclaim their long-term goal: \u2018Death to America.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere may well be a tactical reason why FDD experts have lately stressed the Iran agreement\u2019s threat to America rather than its threat to Israel. AIPAC has followed the same path in an ad called \u201cWe Need a Better Deal,\u201d which its Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran produced. People at AIPAC and FDD may be worried that they will be accused of acting solely in Israel\u2019s interest or of putting Israel\u2019s interest before that of the United States. But there is a no evidence the FDD experts have done so. Almost certainly, they have all along believed that what was in Israel\u2019s interest in this case was in America\u2019s. But by now soft-pedaling their fears of the agreement\u2019s effect on Israel, they have made it difficult for politicians and the public to evaluate their arguments against a nuclear deal.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a policy group or lobby demanding that the United States heed the security of another country. The United States is a global power and has an interest in maintaining stability and preventing war even in regions where it is not directly threatened. The issue here is not whether the United States should take Israel\u2019s interest and security into account, but rather what Israel\u2019s interest is and where its security really lies. From its beginning, FDD has interpreted Israel\u2019s interest\u2014whether regionally or in its conflict with the Palestinians\u2014in accordance with what Netanyahu and the Likud party have said it is. But many Israeli military and intelligence experts believe that the nuclear agreement is in Israel\u2019s interest. And the more liberal lobby group J Street\u2014which has far less money but is gaining in numbers and support on AIPAC\u2014argues that the agreement is in both America\u2019s and Israel\u2019s interests.\n\nI recently asked May whether he and his experts had conferred on the Iran deal with the Israeli government, and whether their views on it accorded with the government\u2019s. \u201cWe have listened to French, Jordanians, Germans, Danes, Israelis and others,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe provide analysis and advice when requested. We take instructions from no one. We are neither an embassy nor an editorial page.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019ve seen no evidence that May and FDD \u201ctake instructions\u201d from the Israelis. That\u2019s not the point. It is the degree to which their argument against the Iran agreement hinges on viewing Israel\u2019s and America\u2019s interests the way Netanyahu and the Likud party view them, and whether this view is correct.\n\nThis article was published in collaboration with the American Foreign Policy Project.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf17b04235215b082e3d0"}}
