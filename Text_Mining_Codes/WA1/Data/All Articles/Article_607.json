To Sherman and McNamara, counseling is pure speech, and the ban should thus be subject to strict First Amendment analysis.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nSherman and McNamara are wrong\u2014but so is the Ninth Circuit. Counseling isn\u2019t pure speech, nor is it simple conduct: It\u2019s a heavily regulated form of medical treatment delivered through the vehicle of speech. And despite this expressive component, the state has every right to regulate counseling\u2019s standards and practices\u2014even if that means censoring some counselors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNot that the law actually allows much censorship. Contrary to Sherman and McNamara\u2019s implications, California\u2019s law is narrowly tailored to one group only: mental-health professionals licensed by the state. (Those who violate the statute merely lose their license to practice.) California leaves untouched any preacher or parent who wants to \u201cconvert\u201d a gay child on his own time, as well as any counselor who performs such \u201ctherapy\u201d in her capacity as an ordinary citizen. The law permits ex-gay \u201ctreatment\u201d for consenting adults and allows licensed counselors to refer minors to religious leaders in order to be \u201ccured\u201d of their homosexuality. The only people affected by the California law are licensed counselors who want to perform ex-gay \u201ctherapy\u201d on minors in their capacity as licensed counselors.\n\nWhy might the state want to ban such a practice? Not because it\u2019s morally reprehensible, as Sherman and McNamara suggest, but because it\u2019s a ridiculous pseudo-scientific fraud. Ex-gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d isn\u2019t really therapy at all: It\u2019s total, unadulterated quackery, a painful process of humiliation and degradation that only breeds shame, self-loathing, and despair in the \u201cpatient.\u201d It\u2019s been condemned by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Psychological Association, none of which allows its members to practice it. Victims of ex-gay \u201ctherapy\u201d face a considerably heightened risk of depression, anxiety, and PTSD; many commit suicide. No respected medical or mental-health group in the country supports conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d; most consider it noxious, toxic, and immensely harmful. (Not to mention the fact that it doesn\u2019t work.)\n\nWould California allow a licensed physician to offer a similarly fraudulent treatment based on utterly debunked science? Of course not. An ER doctor wouldn\u2019t be permitted to give a heart attack victim Pepto-Bismol in lieu of performing surgery. A physician couldn\u2019t elect to perform Reiki instead of resetting a broken bone. The only distinction between these acts of quackery and ex-gay conversion therapy is that counseling involves speech\u2014but so, too, could a broad range of other medical treatments. If a doctor elected to treat a patient\u2019s broken hip with an hour of talk therapy rather than surgery, would the state allow him to keep his license? Almost certainly not, despite the fact that his offense falls squarely within the realm of speech.\n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to Sherman and McNamara\u2019s defense of anti-gay speech in general; the First Amendment obviously protects homophobic expression, just as it protects speech by fundamentalist lunatics, tobacco companies, and anti-abortion extremists. The authors\u2019 criticism of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning, moreover, is well-founded: Shunting counseling into the category of \u201cconduct\u201d and short-circuiting the First Amendment analysis does a disservice to those genuinely concerned about balancing counselors\u2019 free-speech rights with the needs of their patients.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf15304235215b082e3b5"}}
