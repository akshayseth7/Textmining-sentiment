Billing itself as a trendier alternative to more traditional corporate long term hotels, ROOST wants its accommodations to feel more like residences rather than hotel suites.\n\nThe studios \u2014 which were designed by the same architects responsible for the Wythe Hotel \u2014 come fully furnished with Bonavita coffee makers, complimentary La Colombe coffee, bath products, Apple TV, and Bosch washers and dryers. Besides that, there\u2019s a bike share program, fitness center, and a 24-hour front desk, and it\u2019s pet-friendly. There\u2019s a second ROOST property set to open in the Rittenhouse neighborhood of the city soon. A studio suite starts at $175 per night, and a one-bedroom starts at $191.\n\nAKA is another brand that caters to the long term traveler by combining the hospitality you would receive at a hotel with the comfort you would experience at a luxury condominium. There are services that you would find in an apartment building such as a doorman and maintenance services, but then there\u2019s also more hotel-oriented services such as in-suite dining and valet laundering.\n\nAKA even partnered with places such as New York City\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, and the wine store Acker Merrall & Condit in order to help guests immerse themselves in the culture of their temporary home. Besides New York, AKA has hotels in multiple other major US cities (LA, Washington, and Philadelphia), as well as one location in London.\n\nAKA\u2019s rates vary greatly depending on location \u2014 in Washington DC, suites start at $194, at Central Park they start at $305, and in Beverly Hills they start at $395. Guests also have the option of purchasing and owning a condominium at three of AKA\u2019s NYC locations.\n\nThe Redbury is a trendy version of the extended stay boutique hotel with locations in Hollywood, California, and South Beach, Florida. Guests have the choice of staying long term or short term. The hotel is made up of all suites \u2014 57 at the Hollywood location and 69 in South Beach \u2014 that are described as warm, Bohemian, and old-world. The suites\u2019 kitchens have gas burners, the bathrooms have walk-in rain showers, and there are even vinyl collections curated by Capitol Records. In South Beach, there\u2019s a rooftop pool. Suites at the LA location starts at $252 per night, and $239 at the South Beach location.\n\nThe concept of cool luxury extended stay hotels is making waves in Europe as well. The London-based Living Rooms has four locations in hip neighborhoods throughout the city. Like its name suggests, this \u201chotel alternative\u201d aims to make travelers feel like they are staying in a private space that\u2019s their own. A little pricier than some of its other long term competitors, a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at Living Rooms costs $703 per night.\n\nZoku \u2014 which is Japanese for family, tribe, or clan \u2014 is set to open this fall in Amsterdam. It offers a \u201cflexible home/office hybrid\u201d where guests can live, work, socialize, and relax with other guests. The hotel offers a living room, working space, kitchen / dining area, game room, meeting spaces, and a 24-hour store. Most of the rooms are loft spaces \u2014 meaning that unlike most other hotel rooms, the bed is not the focal point of the room \u2014 which guests can decorate and make their own.\n\nThe trend isn\u2019t limited to boutique hotels, though. Marriot\u2019s Residence Inn is set to open this fall in downtown Chicago, and according to Conde Nast Traveler, Element by Starwood has over 20 hotels set to open in the US and Canada by 2018 that will feature modern interiors, pantries stocked with gourmet options, and a lobby that doubles as a work space and bar.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf01104235215b082e2a5"}}
