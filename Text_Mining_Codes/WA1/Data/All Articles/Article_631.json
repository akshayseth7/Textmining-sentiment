There was no applause from the fiscally conservative crowd for that one. Go figure.\n\n\u201cYou look at what is going with the various things that our country is doing and then you hear politicians, and all you hear is all talk, no action,\u201d the mogul said in his speech before the state GOP\u2019s \u201cFirst in the Nation\u201d summit.\n\n\u201cI am actually disappointed with a lot of the Republican politicians,\u201d he continued, \u201cI am a conservative Republican.\u201d He then rattled off a series of policy ideas of which he either approves or disproves:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, \u201cwhich is a disaster,\u201d he said, \u201chas to be repealed and replaced.\u201d That line drew applause.\n\n\u201cWhether it is we are going to cut Social Security, because that\u2019s what they are saying,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvery Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it on Medicaid. And we can\u2019t do that. And it\u2019s not fair to the people that have been paying in for years and now all of the sudden they want to be cut.\u201d\n\nNo applause there. Know your audience, man.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans and the Democrats don\u2019t know how to bring jobs back to our country,\u201d he added.\n\nBut in classic tone-deaf Trump fashion, he followed up that remark with a rallying cry for his own potential presidency: \u201cIf i run and if I win, I will bring jobs back. Believe me. We will bring them back from china, where they are ripping us like you have never seen.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d reach out for comment, but we already know Trump will say he had the audience on their feet and was the best speaker at this year\u2019s summit.\n\nWatch the clip below, via C-SPAN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf17904235215b082e3ce"}}
