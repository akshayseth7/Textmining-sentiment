Of course! Wait, who? DeBeck was a cartoonist who penned Barney Google, a popular comic during the 1920s. It was so popular that songs were written about dear Barney, and the term heebie-jeebie in particular inspired a song called \u201cHeebie-Jeebies\u201d by Louis Armstrong. Him, you\u2019ve heard of. That song in turn, inspired a short-lived dance craze called, you guessed it, the Heebie-Jeebie.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21604235215b082e42e"}}
