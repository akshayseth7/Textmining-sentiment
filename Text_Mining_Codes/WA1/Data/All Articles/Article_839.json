Illustration by Charlie Powell.\n\nHello Slate Plusters! (Slate Plussards? Plussians? We\u2019ll have to work on this.)\n\nI\u2019m Gabriel Roth, the newly installed editorial director of Slate Plus. After two weeks I\u2019m mostly starting to think of myself as a Slate employee rather than a guy who somehow got a key to the building.\n\nHere\u2019s what it\u2019s like around here: On my first day we hired one of my favorite critics, Laura Miller. First she turned around this deft assessment of a newly unearthed Fitzgerald story; then she filed this beautiful piece on the problem of teenage girls in books and movies.\n\nGabriel Roth Gabriel Roth is a Slate senior editor and the editorial director of Slate Plus. Follow him on Twitter.\n\n\n\nThen culture editor Dan Kois had to go to jury duty and was like, \u201cGabe, please edit this essay by another of your favorite critics, Scott Tobias, formerly of the AV Club and the Dissolve, about one of your favorite filmmakers,\u201d and I was like, \u201cUh, OK.\u201d\n\nThen Google changed its name to Alphabet, kind of, except that it\u2019ll still be called Google. And managing editor Lowen Liu chose to argue, wrongly, that \u201cAlphabet Is the Worst Name the New Google Could Have Called Itself.\u201d Although Alphabet is obviously a much better name than the childish \u201cGoogle,\u201d the essay is perfect and hilarious and proves that Lowen doesn\u2019t write enough, probably because he\u2019s too busy answering my questions about the CMS.\n\nAnd, as you might have heard: Slate Plus signed our 10,000th member (Gist host Mike Pesca called him to say congratulations), and we decided to throw a party to celebrate. If you\u2019re in New York or Washington, D.C., now is the moment to get your tickets. Most of Slate will be there, including our bosses Julia Turner and Jacob Weisberg, writers Jamelle Bouie, Alison Griswold, Joshua Keating, Mark Stern, Seth Stevenson, Katy Waldman, and Jordan Weissmann, podcast stars Mike Pesca and Josh Levin, and at least a dozen editors.\n\nWe\u2019re all excited to meet our members, hear your thoughts, and say thank you for supporting Slate, so please come along and say hi. I\u2019ll be the tall one with the beard.\n\nSee you there!", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf33504235215b082e49f"}}
