There had been some nasty name-calling and a few violent threats, but he wasn\u2019t bothered: He reckoned the anger, racism, and vitriol he had encountered on Twitter and Facebook weren\u2019t \u201creal.\u201d They didn\u2019t affect real politics, or real life. He isn\u2019t alone in this assumption.\n\nMost people\u2014the vast majority\u2014do not look at their cellphones several times an hour and would never imagine that Twitter is reality. Even those who do stay abreast of current events via some form of social media generally assume that whatever nastiness they encounter online doesn\u2019t affect anything important. If there is a political impact, it\u2019s on niche movements or Islamic extremists. Jon Ronson\u2019s recent book, So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, explores the madness of the Twitter mobs that destroy the lives of people who tell unfortunate jokes, but until now, we\u2019ve still believed that mainstream politics were safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWatching Donald Trump bluster and bluff his way through a presidential campaign, I wonder if we underestimate the ways in which Internet vitriol has broadened the parameters of political debate. We are \u201cshocked, shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s language, but all of it is exactly the sort of thing anyone can encounter in the normal course of reading about politics online. John McCain isn\u2019t a war hero? I\u2019ll bet he finds worse insults than that on his Facebook page, and so does everybody who writes about him. All Mexicans are rapists? I open my Twitter account every morning to find similar and worse (my personal favorite, translated from Polish: \u201cReading what that @anneapplebaum writes I understand anti-semitism. Jews have an incredible gift for pissing you off\u201d).\n\nThe language of online political discourse is now so extreme, and often so far divorced from reality, that Trump\u2019s words fit right in, especially when they make no sense. Trump\u2019s defenders\u2014and I know because they tell me so online\u2014say they admire him because he is allegedly \u201canti-establishment.\u201d They are wrong: He isn\u2019t anti-establishment at all. As a vastly wealthy man\u2014as one who can invite a former president and his then-senator wife to his wedding and expect them to come\u2014he actually lives at the very heart of a certain slice of the establishment. But of course he is different from other politicians in another sense: He is the only presidential candidate who uses, on television, the kind of language normally found in the comment section of a celebrity website or the more aggressive Reddit forums. Vulgar insults, racist slurs, manufactured \u201canger,\u201d and invented \u201cfacts\u201d are all a normal part of debate in those kinds of public spaces. Thanks to Trump, they have now migrated to presidential politics, too.\n\nAs others have noted, protest candidates are hardly a uniquely American phenomenon. Silvio Berlusconi brought the language and style of Italian tabloid television into the center of Italian politics; multiple far-right ideologues have brought anger and bombast into European debates. In Britain, the obscurantist far left is having a revival in the form of Jeremy Corbyn, a bearded Marxist\u2014he favors the nationalization of industry and nuclear disarmament\u2014who may well be the next leader of the Labour Party. All of these candidates appeal to electorates who have strong online ties but don\u2019t hear their views reflected in mainstream politics. Trump falls into that category, too. But instead of the far left or the far right, he speaks for the sarcastic hate-tweeters, the anti-everything nihilists, and the conspiracy theorists who write convoluted anonymous comments at the bottom of newspaper articles.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1b704235215b082e400"}}
