IBM was for Orwellian conformists; Apple was for those who \u201cthink different.\u201d A Mac was a young guy in a hoodie; a PC was John Hodgman in a suit.\n\nIn the smartphone era, the landscape has shifted. Google\u2019s Android is the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system. But it\u2019s Apple\u2019s iOS that commands the long lines, fat profit margins, and perch atop the cultural zeitgeist. Google has responded by turning some of Apple\u2019s old underdog marketing tactics against it: \u201cBe together, not the same,\u201d Android commercials urge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow different are the people who use iPhones, really, from those who use Android devices? Various studies have helped to construct a basic demographic sketch of each: iOS users are reputedly younger, richer, spendier, and even \u201csmarter.\u201d Android users are, well, the opposite. But none of those metrics tells us much about what the two groups are actually like\u2014how they eat, drink, shop, or play.\n\nNew data from Yelp, the popular local-business reviews site, shed fresh light on how users of the two leading mobile operating systems differ in their online behavior. The data, culled from hundreds of millions of Yelp searches on mobile devices over a six-month period, compare the relative popularity of dozens of popular search queries on each platform.* Yelp recently shared the data with Slate, and we decided it would be fun to share it with you\u2014but more fun to quiz you on it first. (Update, Aug. 7, 2015: You can read Yelp\u2019s own blog post on this data, including its interpretation of some of the results, on the Yelp Engineering Blog.)\n\nTest your assumptions in the quiz below, and then read on for some interpretation of the results, including some interesting caveats on the methodology.\n\nLoading Quiz ...\n\nThe Yelp data, assembled by the company\u2019s data science team, is fascinating in a few ways. At first glance it seems to confirm a host of stereotypes about Android and iOS users while curiously defying a few others.\n\nYes, iOS users sip wine, gulp Starbucks, and splurge on organics at Whole Foods. Android users get tattoos, and hit the buffet, and are always on the hunt for deals. In fact, \u201cdeals\u201d showed a greater discrepancy in popularity between the two platforms than any other search term Yelp shared with us. It was the 24th-most-popular Android search, but didn\u2019t even crack the top 200 on iOS.\n\nBut Android users also search more for \u201cyoga,\u201d which might seem like the sort of upper-middle-class pursuit you\u2019d associate with iOSers. They appear to prefer cupcakes to donuts. And if Android users are older than their Jobs-worshipping counterparts, they sure don\u2019t party like it. Danceclubs, nightlife, and karaoke all ranked higher on Android.\n\nOne nice thing about the Yelp data is that such findings are highly unlikely to be an artifact of a small sample size. Indeed, the sample of all Yelp searches in the U.S. over a six-month period is enormous, revealing differences in behavior too subtle to capture in an ordinary survey.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other forms of bias at work, though. We talked with Travis Brooks, who heads Yelp\u2019s data-mining team, about what could be behind some of the behavior differences that aren\u2019t readily explained by variables like age or class. He told us he doesn\u2019t have hard answers for why, say, \u201cyoga\u201d ranks higher among search queries on Android than it does on iOS. But he does have some hypotheses about how factors other than simple consumer preference might shape users\u2019 queries.\n\nFor one thing, searching for something frequently on Yelp doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to partaking in it habitually. Imagine you\u2019re a lifelong yogi: You might know your favorite studios so well that you have no need to look up customer reviews of them. A cupcake addict might not need a Yelp search to find his next fix, but he might pull up the app on the occasions when he feels the urge to try donuts instead. Or perhaps iOS users search for donuts on Yelp because they\u2019re hoping online reviews will steer them to the fanciest, trendiest, most artisanal donuts, whereas Android users are content to hit the nearest Dunkin\u2019.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s trying too hard to make the results mesh with popular preconceptions. After all, one could use the same logic to undermine the more intuitive findings (e.g., perhaps it\u2019s really Android users who prefer Starbucks and Whole Foods, and that\u2019s why they search for them more rarely). At some point the exercise devolves into a Rorschach blot\u2014you interpret what you want to interpret.\n\nBrooks also raised a subtler and wonkier point that might help explain some of the data. Users\u2019 Yelp searches aren\u2019t shaped only by their own preferences. They\u2019re also shaped by the design of each platform\u2019s software interface\u2014the user experience, in Silicon Valley lingo. For instance, both Android and iOS have autocomplete features that attempt to guess the words their users are trying to type. Those features rely on different algorithms, so typing the same few letters might yield different autocomplete terms on each operating system. The Yelp interface is also slightly different on each platform, perhaps encouraging users to type in full search terms on one while browsing preset categories on the other. Brooks told us that iOS users are more than twice as likely to include apostrophes in business names.\n\nBrooks couldn\u2019t say for sure what software quirks or demographic differences might explain which results in the data Yelp provided. Anecdotally, however, we found one relatively consistent discrepancy between the terms most popular with Android users and those ranked highest on iOS. The top-ranked Android searches were more likely to be generic terms like \u201cdeals,\u201d \u201cparks,\u201d or \u201cbeer and wine,\u201d while the top-ranked iOS searches were more often name brands like \u201cTarget,\u201d \u201cChipotle,\u201d or \u201cSephora.\u201d That would seem to imply that iPhone users are more brand-conscious than those who opt for Android devices. But then, perhaps that\u2019s the one thing we already knew for sure.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf19a04235215b082e3e4"}}
