The Tianjin Goldin Metropolitan Polo Club, which markets itself as China\u2019s largest polo club and a haven for China\u2019s \u201cnew nobility,\u201d opened five years ago and features luxury amenities that go far beyond equestrian sports facilities. In addition to three polo fields with 300 stables, the club also promotes features such as its hotel, 12 restaurants, wine cellar, gym, pool, spa, event facilities, and\u2014most importantly\u2014luxury real estate.\n\nManaged by Hong Kong real estate developer Goldin Properties, the Tianjin club features 1,500 luxury apartments as well as standalone villas that offer free club membership with purchase. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a polo club, but we\u2019re selling the polo lifestyle,\u201d says Domenico Palumbo, the club\u2019s general manager. \u201cWe want them to embrace the total concept that we are offering\u2014coming in, purchasing an apartment, moving in with their families, and automatically becoming members of the club. It\u2019s not just about watching polo.\u201d\n\nThe polo club is located in 20,000-square-kilometer business district being developed by Goldin, which includes the 596-meter Goldin Finance 117 tower that will be the world\u2019s ninth-tallest building when completed. The company is pushing forward with this development at a time when China is working to develop Tianjin, Beijing, and Hebei as an integrated metropolis and commerce center.\n\nThe company sees polo as a novel and upscale way to attract China\u2019s wealthiest individuals to the new district. \u201cWe\u2019re the gimmick to sell the property, the hotel, the business area,\u201d says John Fisher, the polo club\u2019s director of stable operations and acting deputy general manager. \u201cWhen we have 2,000 people living there, then it will be a club.\u201d\n\nBut in order for this to be effective, the company first needs to convince China\u2019s rich that the new sport is worth their time and money. \u201cIt\u2019s slow and it will be slow,\u201d says Fisher of the growth of Chinese interest in polo. He estimates that since 2010, about 2,000 to 3,000 horses have been brought into China annually for both polo and other equestrian sports. \u201cPolo is something new,\u201d says Palumbo. \u201cPolo, I think at this stage, is like golf in 1982 when they started with the first golf club.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the club has been on a significant marketing push to promote the polo lifestyle to well-heeled Chinese consumers. At the recent SO! Dalian yacht and lifestyle show in June, Tianjin Goldin sponsored a team that included two Chinese players at the event\u2019s beach polo tournament. One of the players in the tournament was Arthur Lin, a 13-year-old who has been training for a year and represents the hope that the polo industry is placing in China\u2019s younger generation.\n\nAttracting parents interested in signing their kids up for polo lessons is a main part of the strategy for creating future growth of the sport in China, says Fisher. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with the youngsters because we believe that if you start with the younger generation, it carries on with them to their kids, the next kids.\u201d While the club currently has about 10-20 older players showing up for regular lessons, it sees between 20-30 kids in its junior training program.\n\nThere are a few obstacles to getting China\u2019s wealthy to participate in larger numbers, however. \u201cIt takes time to learn to ride,\u201d says Fisher. While many adults don\u2019t have the time to learn such a training-intensive activity, they\u2019re also worried about signing their children up. \u201cThey don\u2019t want their kids to get hurt,\u201d says Fisher, who notes that the the club is trying to \u201cchange the mentality\u201d among Chinese parents that polo is dangerous.\n\nIn order to get more kids on board, the club is taking advantage of wealthy Chinese parents\u2019 well-known reverence the Ivy League with special intervarsity tournaments that fly in players from schools including Harvard and Yale. \u201cThe idea of doing that is that we show China and other kids what these kids do,\u201d says Fisher of the tournaments. \u201cThese are people that go to top universities and play polo as part of their school curriculum.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the polo club sponsors other major tournaments throughout the year, bringing in teams from global polo centers including England, Argentina, the United States, and Hong Kong. It also hosts the international Snow Polo World Cup, which is organized by the International Polo Association. The club is currently in expansion mode as it builds a massive indoor stadium with a retractable roof and capacity for 5,000 people, including special boxes for VIPs.\n\nIf successful, the sport can mean big business for Goldin in terms of not only real estate sales, but corporate sponsorship. \u201cThe idea that we want is when the property is sold and it\u2019s full, that we will attract these people to come and play, but also with the business area, you will have companies there that will sponsor our events,\u201d says Fisher. Luxury companies \u201care going to use polo to sell their brands. There\u2019s a lot of companies that want to get into China, so they will use golf; they will use polo\u2014they will use whatever angle they can to get in.\u201d\n\nFor now, the industry is making a long-term investment based on the hope that polo will become part of a way of life for China\u2019s rich. Fisher estimates that the sport will take off in China within \u201cthe next 10 or 20 years.\u201d\n\nAs one final selling point, the polo club also makes sure to point out that the sport\u2019s history in China extends back over 1,000 years. According to Fisher, \u201cWhen we do a speech, we say that polo started here and we\u2019re bringing it back. It was here first.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf23e04235215b082e44d"}}
