Every month, McDonald\u2019s announces how much sales have grown (or fallen) at restaurants open at least 13 months in its various market segments and across the globe. Lately, those figures have been nothing but dreadful. As of April, McDonald\u2019s global same-store sales had shrunk for 11 consecutive months while its U.S. numbers had either declined or stayed largely flat. February was particularly bad: Sales plunged 4 percent in the U.S. and 1.7 percent globally, prompting McDonald\u2019s to admit it needed to become a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company.\u201d\n\n\n\nData from McDonald\u2019s. Chart by Alison Griswold.\n\n\n\nBut the McDonald\u2019s Misery Watch is about to become less frequent: The company is ending its monthly reporting practice, which it began in 2003. According to Bloomberg, the company plans to stop reporting monthly same-store sales after June, when its second-quarter earnings are released. \u201cTo focus our activities and conversations around the strategic, longer-term actions we are taking as part of our plan, we have decided to discontinue our monthly sales disclosure, effective July 1,\u201d Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s chief executive, said at an analysts conference in New York City on Wednesday. Other items on McDonald\u2019s turnaround agenda: increased hourly wages for employees of its corporate-owned stores, more control for franchisees, customized burgers, and all-day breakfast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21e04235215b082e434"}}
