Well, the reality is that we really need to start expanding our view of who we will ascribe opportunities for redemption to. Not just to these so-called nonviolent prisoners, but all prisoners who are worthy of redemption. So, I\u2019m one that has been talking about this issue for some time, this failure to include so-called violent offenders.\n\nYeah, well, I have a problem with that. I\u2019ve spoken out about it a lot\u2014that you\u2019re not gonna solve this problem until we start having a real conversation about so-called violent offenders.\n\nThe other thing I hear people worry about a lot is that the legislation that\u2019s been proposed by Congress so far is all geared exclusively toward nonviolent offenders. Why is that?\n\nYeah. The same way that this idea of mass incarceration went viral throughout our society in the \u201970s, \u201980s, and \u201990s, there needs to be a similar movement back to some rationality and pragmatism. So what we\u2019re doing at the federal level is really important.\n\nSo you see it as a two-way street, where the states are inspiring the federal government to act, and the federal government will inspire other states that haven\u2019t moved on this?\n\nFirst of all\u2014move the needle? For the guy who doesn\u2019t spend 50 years in prison for a nonviolent offense, that moves the needle a lot for his life. But also, we live in a nation where, when New Jersey figures out how to do something and does it well, and shows progress, it affects other states. When I was mayor I looked at other cities for innovations and reforms. And so for the federal government to make moves on solitary confinement, make moves on reducing mandatory minimums and three-strikes laws, that makes a big impact on thousands of Americans. But it also will have an impact, I think, on a lot of states as well.\n\nThere are relatively few prisoners in the federal system. Would any of the federal legislation people are talking about really move the needle, even if there was comprehensive reform passed?\n\nWell, look, I think it\u2019s really noble for organizations like Cut50 to put specific numbers out there. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for the United States to be so out of step with our industrial peers, and for us as a society to be heaping this self-imposed burden on us that drags our economy, reduces productivity for such a large percentage of our citizenry, that drives poverty. I have never articulated a specific number, but I think a nation as great as we are, that professes to favor freedom and liberty, that we would find a way to evidence that in our criminal justice system by achieving what we know we can achieve: a reduction in crime, a reduction in taxpayer expense, and a reduction in the prison population.\n\nWhen you look at the total number of people who are behind bars in America\u2014it\u2019s about 1.5 million in state prisons , about 200,000 or so in federal prisons , and about 700,000 in local jails on any given day\u2014how much do you want to reduce those numbers? Do you have a goal in mind that you think is realistic?\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about anything being negotiated. But obviously there are pieces of legislation already out there that I think are important, like the Smarter Sentencing Act. You know, mandatory minimums, three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out laws\u2014all those front-end policies that we have, that have been such a major source of our mass incarceration problem, need to be addressed. There are other aspects of reform that are just as critical\u2014many of which are [bills] that I\u2019ve either proposed or co-sponsored: everything from the elimination of procedures like solitary confinement, which many people consider torture, all the way to helping people to reintegrate, so we don\u2019t have such a stunningly high recidivism rate nationally as we do.\n\nSen. Cory Booker: Well, look, there\u2019s a lot of great energy that\u2019s building in Washington, as you know. There is, on the House side, a piece of legislation that\u2019s already been introduced, that has a lot of good elements to it, and there is a lot of work here in the Senate\u2014conversations I\u2019m involved in\u2014about trying to get a piece of solid legislation sometime in the coming months. So, I\u2019m hopeful. Obviously it\u2019s not moving as fast as I would like. And a lot of the efforts are great steps but not as comprehensive as I would like. But I just feel grateful that there\u2019s a bipartisan coalition trying to get something done in this Congress.\n\nLeon Neyfakh: We\u2019ve been hearing for many months now that we\u2019re going to see criminal justice reform soon. From where you\u2019re sitting, do you have a sense of when it might actually happen?\n\nOne exception is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, whom I spoke to by phone on Friday. During our conversation, Booker expressed unequivocal support for a position that has not yet become popular with his colleagues in Washington: If the United States is serious about ending mass incarceration, it will require more than just lenience for drug offenders and other low-level criminals.\n\nThere are two big reasons for this. The first is that the proposed legislation would only apply to the federal prison system, which houses just 10 percent of the nation\u2019s inmates. The second is that, of the more than 1.5 million people in state prisons, about half are there because they\u2019ve been convicted of violent offenses like murder, rape, and armed robbery. Most politicians don\u2019t have the stomach to talk about reducing sentences for violent offenders.\n\nThe emerging consensus has created the impression that reform is around the corner\u2014and it might very well be. But none of the proposed legislation that\u2019s currently on the table can be expected to shrink the prison population by all that much .\n\nBeing in favor of criminal justice reform these days is fashionable in Washington. Politicians from the left and the right seem to agree that with 2.2 million people either in federal prison, state prison, or jail, the United States is keeping a shameful percentage of its population behind bars.\n\nAt the big Bipartisan Criminal Justice Summit in D.C. a couple of months back, you said something like, \u201cWe need to redefine what it means to commit a violent crime.\u201d Can you elaborate on that? Some people might think the line between violent and nonviolent would be straightforward. Why isn\u2019t it?\n\nIt\u2019s just not. I mean, we\u2019ve lumped a lot of things [into the violent category]\u2014 accomplices to crimes, robberies that often don\u2019t involve physical violence. But I think we need to look at the totality of the things that we\u2019re labeling as violent and really examine whether we need to have some more proportionality in terms of the punishment fitting the crime that\u2019s done. The bright line that we have right now, between violent and nonviolent, does not account for shades of gray.\n\nDo you make this argument when you talk to other legislators?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely been part of my conversations. But frankly as of now it\u2019s not going that far.\n\nWhat kind of reaction do you get?\n\nLet\u2019s just say the appetite is not there at this point for expanding that. There are still battles being fought over basic criminal justice reform for so-called nonviolent offenders.\n\nDo you see it as a question of incremental progress, where reform for nonviolent offenders will open up the political space for bigger, broader measures later?\n\nThat\u2019s my hope. I hope that as we start putting points on the board for fiscal responsibility when it comes to criminal justice, and for justice, for proportionality, for fairness, we can expand after that to this gray area where we have people labeled as violent offenders but weren\u2019t directly involved in acts of significant violence. So my hope is that once we get some momentum, we\u2019ll be able to address a much larger pool of people.\n\nOne concern I\u2019ve heard from activists and academics is that there\u2019s a conventional wisdom forming that the reason our prison population is so huge is because of nonviolent offenders. Even President Obama, during his big criminal justice speech in July, said, \u201cOver the last few decades we\u2019ve also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before, for longer than ever before, and that is the real reason our prison population is so high.\u201d When I heard that, I just thought, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nWell, look, the drug war certainly has driven an explosion in incarceration, and drug crimes do make up a very large percentage of what we have. But again, we\u2019ve been doling out harsher and harsher penalties for all crimes.\n\nI\u2019ve seen research that says only 17 percent of the inmates in state prisons are there for drug charges. Just 17 percent! Whereas 50 percent or so are there for crimes that are classified as violent. Does that mean talking about the problem in the way Congress has been talking about it puts a pretty low ceiling on how much of a reduction in the prison population we can achieve?\n\nRight, but there\u2019s some other data that we should talk about. Michelle Alexander [author of The New Jim Crow] talks about how much marijuana arrests have fueled the explosion in arrests in our country. Her point is that we end up sending so many young people, particularly young African-Americans and Latinos, into the system. And what happens once you get a felony conviction? Now you are entering this American caste system where you can\u2019t get a job, you can\u2019t get a loan, you can\u2019t get a Pell grant, you can\u2019t get public housing. And then those people often feel that they have no other options, so they go back and commit crime again. And again, and again. And what we saw in Newark, through a Rutgers study, was that about 84 percent of our murder victims had been arrested before an average of 10 times.\n\nVictims?\n\nVictims. So what I\u2019m saying is that, because of these low-level drug crimes, people get stuck in this world that eventually turns violent. So I\u2019m very concerned about how we\u2019re treating the drug war. And while I definitely want to deal with a more expansive view of who should be eligible for a lot of this legislation, please understand that the drug war has really fueled so much of our problem. The drug war has been a war where the direct casualties have primarily been America\u2019s poor; America\u2019s minorities; and often, unfortunately, America\u2019s vulnerable, in terms of people with disease and addiction and mental health.\n\nThere is some debate around the Michelle Alexander book\u2014there are people who say she overstates the role of the drug war in the mass incarceration boom. And there is data that says the percentage of drug offenders in the prison population peaked in like, 1990, at 22 percent. So even when it was at the highest it has ever been, 4 out of 5 people in prison were there for offenses that didn\u2019t involve drugs. That\u2019s something I hear from folks who are worried that the focus is too much on drug crimes right now.\n\nI guess I\u2019m not into the tyranny of the \u201cor\u201d\u2014 either this or that. This system is broken along many, many dimensions. And to ignore the crisis of America\u2019s drug policies and the devastating impact it\u2019s having in America is a very significant problem. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s not a problem with high mandatory minimums as a whole\u2014which have shifted our whole criminal justice system from courts and judges to prosecutorial discretion. But the situation is bad all over.\n\nAs you said earlier, it\u2019s politically quite difficult to get lawmakers to look at the entire situation, which would mean looking at people who are in prison for doing objectively bad things. That\u2019s a high barrier for a lot of people, because intuitively there\u2019s a pretty powerful argument to be made that the central purpose of prison is to keep violent offenders out of society. But when you look at the data, it seems like it\u2019s an argument that will have to be prevailed upon if we\u2019re ever going to see a really serious drop in the incarceration numbers.\n\nI agree. I agree. There\u2019s a profound, glaring injustice that\u2019s a significant part of our society that needs to be addressed.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee6f04235215b082e1b6"}}
