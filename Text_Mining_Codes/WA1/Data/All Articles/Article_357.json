Bruce Rauner signed a bill barring licensed therapists from attempting to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. Illinois is the fifth American jurisdiction to ban the thoroughly discredited, grotesquely harmful practice, after California, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. Every court to consider these laws has held that they do not run afoul of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has twice refused to review such rulings.\n\nIllinois\u2019 new measure is especially interesting in light of a New Jersey jury\u2019s recent decision that ex-gay conversion therapy constitutes consumer fraud and unconscionable business practice. The Illinois bill builds on this idea. In addition to barring conversion therapy itself, the law forbids licensed therapists from claiming that homosexuality is \u201ca mental disease, disorder, or illness\u201d in advertisements. Any therapist who violates this provision will run afoul of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, opening himself up to state sanctions and private civil suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02604235215b082e2bc"}}
