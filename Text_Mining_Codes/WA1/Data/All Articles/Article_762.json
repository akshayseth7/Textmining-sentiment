{"URL": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/was-the-ashley-madison-database-leaked/", "Text": "Many news sites and blogs are reporting that the data stolen last month from 37 million users of AshleyMadison.com \u2014 a site that facilitates cheating and extramarital affairs \u2014 has finally been posted online for the world to see. In the past 48 hours, several huge dumps of data claiming to be the actual AshleyMadison database have turned up online. But there are precious few details in them that would allow one to verify these claims, and the company itself says it so far sees no indication that the files are legitimate.\n\nUpdate, 11:52 p.m. ET: I\u2019ve now spoken with three vouched sources who all have reported finding their information and last four digits of their credit card numbers in the leaked database. Also, it occurs to me that it\u2019s been almost exactly 30 days since the original hack. Finally, all of the accounts created at Bugmenot.com for Ashleymadison.com prior to the original breach appear to be in the leaked data set as well. I\u2019m sure there are millions of AshleyMadison users who wish it weren\u2019t so, but there is every indication this dump is the real deal.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nA huge trove of data nearly 10 gigabytes in size was dumped onto the Deep Web and onto various Torrent file-sharing services over the past 48 hours. According to a story at Wired.com, included in the files are names, addresses and phone numbers apparently attached to AshleyMadison member profiles, along with credit card data and transaction information. Links to the files were preceded by a text file message titled \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d (see screenshot below).\n\nFrom taking in much of the media coverage of this leak so far \u2014 for example, from the aforementioned Wired piece or from the story at security blogger Graham Cluley\u2019s site \u2014 readers would most likely conclude that this latest collection of leaked data is legitimate. But after an interview this evening with Raja Bhatia \u2014 AshleyMadison\u2019s original founding chief technology officer \u2014 I came away with a different perspective.\n\nBhatia said he is working with an international team of roughly a dozen investigators who are toiling seven days a week, 24-hours a day just to keep up with all of the fake data dumps claiming to be the stolen AshleyMadison database that was referenced by the original hackers on July 19. Bhatia said his team sees no signs that this latest dump is legitimate.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, we\u2019re seeing 30 to 80 different claimed dumps come online, and most of these dumps are entirely fake and being used by other organizations to capture the attention that\u2019s been built up through this release,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cIn total we\u2019ve looked at over 100GB of data that\u2019s been put out there. For example, I just now got a text message from our analysis team in Israel saying that the last dump they saw was 15 gigabytes. We\u2019re still going through that, but for the most part it looks illegitimate and many of the files aren\u2019t even readable.\u201d\n\nThe former AshleyMadison CTO, who\u2019s been consulting for the company ever since news of the hack broke last month, said many of the fake data dumps the company has examined to date include some or all of the files from the original July 19 release. But the rest of the information, he said, is always a mix of data taken from other hacked sources \u2014 not AshleyMadison.com.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming amount of data released in the last three weeks is fake data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re taking every release seriously and looking at each piece of data and trying to analyze the source and the veracity of the data.\u201d\n\nBhatia said the format of the fake leaks has been changing constantly over the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cOriginally, it was being posted through Imgur.com and Pastebin.com, and now we\u2019re seeing files going out over torrents, the Dark Web, and TOR-based URLs,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help locate new troves of data claiming to be the files stolen from AshleyMadison, the company\u2019s forensics team has been using a tool that Netflix released last year called Scumblr, which scours high-profile sites for specific terms and data.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we can quickly verify that it\u2019s not our data or it\u2019s fake data, but we are taking each release seriously,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cScumbler helps accelerate the time it takes for us to detect new pieces of data that are being released. For the most part, we\u2019re finding the majority of it is fake. There are some things that have data from the original release, but other than that, what we\u2019re seeing is other generic files that have been introduced, fake SQL files.\u201d\n\nBhatia said this most recent leak is especially amusing because it included actual credit card data, even though AshleyMadison.com has never stored credit card information.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely not credit card information, because we don\u2019t store that,\u201d Bhatia said. \u201cWe use transaction IDs, just like every other PCI compliant merchant processor. If there is full credit card data in a dump, it\u2019s not from us, because we don\u2019t even have that. When someone completes a payment, what happens is from our payment processor, we get a transaction ID back. That\u2019s the only piece of information linking to a customer or consumer of ours. If someone is releasing credit card data, that\u2019s not from us. We don\u2019t have that in our databases or our own systems.\u201d\n\nI should be clear that I have no idea whether this dump is in fact real; I\u2019m only reporting what I have been able to observe so far. I have certainly seen many people I know on Twitter saying they\u2019ve downloaded the files and found data from friends who\u2019d acknowledged being members of the site.\n\nNearly every day since I first reported the exclusive story of the Ashley Madison hack on July 19, I\u2019ve received desperate and sad emails from readers who were or are AshleyMadison users and who wanted to know if the data would ever be leaked, or if I could somehow locate their information in any documents leaked so far. Unfortunately, aside from what I\u2019ve reported here and in my original story last month, I don\u2019t have any special knowledge or insight into this attack.\n\nMy first report on this breach quoted AshleyMadison CEO Noel Biderman saying the company suspected the culprit was likely someone who at one time had legitimate access to the company\u2019s internal networks. I\u2019d already come to the same conclusion by that time, and I still believe that\u2019s the case. So I asked Bhatia if the company and/or law enforcement in Canada or the United States had apprehended anyone in relation to this hack.\n\nBhatia declined to answer, instead referring me to the written statement posted on its site today, which noted that investigation is still ongoing and that the company is simultaneously cooperating fully with law enforcement investigations, including by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Ontario Provincial Police, the Toronto Police Services and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\u201cThis event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe know that there are people out there who know one or more of these individuals, and we invite them to come forward. While we are confident that the authorities will identify and prosecute each of them to the fullest extent of the law, we also know there are individuals out there who can help to make this happen faster.\u201d\n\nReaders should understand that if this dump does turn out to be legit, that just finding someone\u2019s name, email address and other data in the archives doesn\u2019t mean that person was a real user. As the above-mentioned Graham Cluley points out, AshleyMadison never bothered to verify the email addresses given to it by its users.\n\n\u201cSo, I could have created an account at Ashley Madison with the address of barack.obama@whitehouse.gov, but it wouldn\u2019t have meant that Obama was a user of the site,\u201d Cluley wrote. \u201cJournalists and commentators would be wise to remember that the credentials stored by Ashley Madison must be considered suspect because of their shonky practices, even before you start considering whether any leaked databases are falsified or not.\u201d\n\nTags: Ashley Madison hack, Graham Cluley, Impact Team, Impact Team Hackers, Noel Biderman, Raja Bhatia, wired.com", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2a204235215b082e451"}}
