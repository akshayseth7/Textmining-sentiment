A few hours later the zoo's panda cam showed her playing with the newborn. (Smithsonian National Zoo)\n\nThe giant panda at the National Zoo gave birth to two cubs a few hours apart Saturday, launching a fresh and not totally unexpected chapter in the public romance with the rotund black-and-white bears that have enthralled Washington and legions of panda fanatics for 43 years.\n\nGiant pandas give birth to twins about half the time, a zoo official said.\n\nAfter the first birth, Pamela Baker-Masson, the zoo\u2019s spokeswoman, said the staff was \u201cthrilled, absolutely thrilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in close communication with veterinarians, the scientists, keepers. Everybody\u2019s extremely happy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were all tuned in to the panda cam, and we saw her water break. And then just about an hour later . . . she gave birth to a cub.\u201d\n\nThe second cub was born at 10:07 p.m., Baker-Masson said. It was believed to be healthy, she said late Saturday night.\n\n1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Mei Xiang gives birth to two cubs hours apart View Photos The birth launches a fresh chapter in the public romance with the bears that have enthralled Washington for 43 years.

It was placed in an incubator. It was not clear which of the two cubs it was.\n\nHowever, the zoo said, both cubs would be given the opportunity to bond with their mother. The zoo\u2019s \u201cpanda team\u201d would alternate the cubs between maternal and incubator rearing. One will be nursing and spending time with the mother, while the other would be fed by bottle and kept warm in the incubator.\n\nAuthorities were alerted to the second birth through watching a video feed of the panda habitat.\n\nIt occurred quickly, more rapidly than the day\u2019s first birth, Baker-Masson said.\n\nThe loud vocalizations from the first cub after birth were a \u201cgreat sign for good health,\u201d said Baker-Masson, who added that staffers watched with awe as the mother picked up her cub, about the size of a stick of butter.\n\nInside the panda house Saturday afternoon, a small, rapt knot of onlookers watched on a video monitor as Mei Xiang tossed and turned in her cage. About 4:30 p.m., zoo officials confirmed that the panda\u2019s water had broken.\n\nSusan Powell, 51, had been standing with her son and granddaughter as Mei Xiang labored on the black-and-white screen. Powell, who was visiting her son from her home outside of Magnolia, Ark., said the event was a rare treat.\n\n\u201cIn south Arkansas, we don\u2019t have anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get deer and foxes, but not pandas.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s granddaughter Jorja, 7, sat on a wooden block nearby with her father. \u201cI think it\u2019s really cool,\u201d the girl said. Her nickname when she was younger, she said, was \u201cPanda\u201d \u2014 because she is half-white and half-Asian, she joked.\n\nSuddenly at 5:33, someone said, \u201cI think it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nA silence fell over the crowd. \u201cCome on, sweet mama,\u201d Powell said. \u201cCome on, baby.\u201d\n\nAt 5:35, the first glimpse of the baby came on the screen. People burst into applause and shouted, \u201cYes! Yes! Oh, my God!\u201d\n\nJorja jumped up: \u201cShe had a baby!\u201d\n\nMei Xiang, who went into labor about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, has already delivered two surviving cubs since 2005 \u2014 Tai Shan on July 9, 2005, and Bao Bao on Aug. 23, 2013.\n\nShe gave birth to a stillborn cub about 26 hours after Bao Bao. And on Sept. 16, 2012, she gave birth to a cub with liver abnormalities, and it died six days later.\n\n[From the archives: Panda cub dies after one week.]\n\nGiant panda cubs, like many newborns at the zoo, are extremely fragile. Six other giant panda cubs have died at the zoo dating to the 1980s.\n\nThe birth came three years after zoo officials were prepared to request replacements for Mei Xiang and the zoo\u2019s male giant panda, Tian Tian, because of their poor reproductive record. In 2011, the pair had gone five years without producing a cub.\n\nThe first new cub was the second in two years.\n\n[From the archives: Five minutes of terror, then joy over birth of panda cub ]\n\nAt a news conference after the first birth Saturday, zoo officials cautioned that Mei Xiang and her cub would need to be monitored very closely. The mother and her offspring were to be watched on the panda cam around the clock, with staffers on hand at all hours to respond, said the zoo\u2019s director, Dennis Kelly. That was how the second birth was spotted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very cautious,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIn 2012, we lost a cub after six days. This is still a very fragile time for this cub.\u201d\n\nDon Neiffer, the zoo\u2019s chief veterinarian, appeared in his navy scrubs and described the walk-up to the birth. Mei Xiang was behaving very lethargically, and Neiffer on Wednesday had spotted on an ultrasound scan what he said was a developing fetus inside the panda.\n\nIn the last couple of days, Mei Xiang began licking her chest and abdomen in apparent preparation for the birth. After her water broke, \u201cshe was bearing down a bit,\u201d he said, before the cub arrived noisily into the world.\n\nSpeaking of the first cub, Neiffer said no decision had been made on when zoo staffers will examine the cub for paternity, gender and general health, Neiffer said. Naming will come later.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very important bonding going on right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disturb that.\u201d\n\n[Related: Zoo officials spot a fetus]\n\nThe giant panda had been artificially inseminated twice on April 26 and 27 with semen collected from Tian Tian and from a male giant panda at a research center in Wolong, China.\n\nIn 2011, the zoo reached a new lease agreement with China that extended the stay of the two giant pandas for five years. All cubs born in the zoo must be returned to China four years after birth. The new agreement expires Dec. 6, 2015.\n\nThe zoo\u2019s first pandas, Ling-Ling, a female, and Hsing-Hsing, a male, arrived in 1972, one of the fruits of President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s peacemaking visit to China.\n\nThe two have since died. They produced several cubs, but none lived more than a few days.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0fc04235215b082e38d"}}
