Marc Jacobs, Tory Burch and Dian von Furstenberg were just some of the big names who designed tees, totes and other paraphernalia for Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, and the Runway to Win effort ultimately raised over $40 million, campaign manager Jim Messina told Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\n(PHOTOS: Runway to Win Merchandise)\n\nBeyond the financial rewards, Runway to Win also upped the president and his campaign\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d factor among young voters. The effort gave people an affordable way to own designer pieces\u2014even if it was just election gear\u2014and put operatives like Messina alongside celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson at glitzy events hosted in retail shops.\n\nThe fashion industry\u2019s love for President Obama comes second only, of course, to their love of his wife, Michelle, who Wintour recently praised for changing the way American women see fashion by wearing a wide variety of designers and styles. \u201cLook back at the history of First Ladies and you\u2019ll see they wore a good suit or a ball gown,\u201d she told the Telegraph. \u201cNow we have someone who wears J.Crew or Thakoon or Azzedine Ala\u00efa: a gamut of different designers.\u201d And, with a second White House term on the horizon, Michelle Obama will only be adding to that long list.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf31904235215b082e48a"}}
