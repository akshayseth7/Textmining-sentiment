That revelation, first reported by the New York Times on Monday night and later confirmed by the State Department, has opened up the once-and-future White House hopeful to the latest round of criticism about her and her husband\u2019s transparency, or lack thereof.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nI\u2019ll leave the What Does This Mean for 2016? question to my colleagues in Washington, and instead focus on a more immediate one: Was Clinton\u2019s use of private email to do government business a violation of the law?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe short and unsatisfying answer is that no one seems to know for sure. The Times, for example, reports only that Clinton \u201cmay have violated federal requirements.\u201d The Wall Street Journal, likewise, says it\u2019s \u201cunclear\u201d whether she did. Still, that neither paper\u2014nor anyone else\u2014has been able to find a specific law that Clinton violated is telling. My search has also come up empty.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can say: Clinton\u2019s penchant for private email would indeed run afoul of the current law on the books\u2014but likely not the rules that were in place while she served as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Under a law passed this past November, a government official can use private email accounts to conduct government business\u2014but only if that official copies or forwards the email to his or her government account within 20 days. Violating that law can result in disciplinary action but carries with it no criminal penalties. But Clinton\u2019s private emailing occurred well before that law went into effect. According to the National Archives, the official definition of what constitutes a federal record did not \u201cclearly include electronic records\u201d until Obama signed the 2014 law, which represented \u201cthe first change to the definition of a Federal record\u201d since the Federal Records Act was passed in 1950. Similarly, it wasn\u2019t until August 2013\u2014six months after Clinton had left office\u2014that the National Archives and Records Administration issued guidance making it clear that email records of some senior officials are permanent federal records.\n\nClinton\u2019s camp, as you might expect, maintains its boss did nothing wrong. \u201cBoth the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved,\" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Associated Press.\n\nWhile Merrill appears to be correct on the first count, the case for the second\u2014the spirit of the law\u2014is less than convincing. At best, Clinton failed to go the extra mile to make sure her emails were part of the official record; at worst, she intentionally sought out a legal gray area from which to do her business.\n\nThe spirit of the federal archiving of government records is pretty clearly focused on providing an accurate and comprehensive account of administrative decision-making\u2014for the government itself, as well as the American public. Or, as Obama himself put it in a memo to his administration in 2011 (when Clinton was still secretary) that asked his staff to redouble their record-keeping efforts: \u201cImproving records management will improve performance and promote openness and accountability by better documenting agency actions and decisions.\u201d\n\nEven Robert Gibbs, who served as White House spokesman during Clinton\u2019s first two years in the State Department, has suggested that Clinton should have known she wasn\u2019t following standard protocol when she decided to do all her emailing from a private account without taking specific steps to turn over those emails for government record collection. \u201cThere are lots of briefings that you have, certainly when you go into the White House, about preserving any email that you have, making sure it\u2019s part of your official account,\u201d Gibbs said on the Today show Tuesday, calling Clinton\u2019s actions \u201chighly unusual.\u201d\n\nEven if Clinton somehow missed those briefings, it\u2019s hard to imagine she didn\u2019t know better. Washington has a history of email scandals. In 2007, when Clinton was a senator running for president, Democrats blasted the George W. Bush administration when it was discovered that Karl Rove and other White House advisors had been using the Republican National Committee email system to send and receive messages, a large number of which were deleted before being archived. Obama\u2019s team has run into its own email problems as well\u2014most notably EPA chief Lisa P. Jackson, who used a secondary account with a less-than-obvious email handle, and former IRS official Lois Lerner, who had thousands of official emails go missing, much to the dismay of the congressional Republicans investigating her.\n\nClinton\u2019s team maintains that any email she sent or received to anyone else in the government would have been preserved on their end\u2014an argument that relies on her colleagues using the same type of .gov address that she herself avoided. That defense also conveniently ignores any government business she may have conducted with foreign leaders or private parties outside the U.S. government.\n\nClinton\u2019s team says she turned over 55,000 pages of emails from her personal account to the State Department late last year at its request, but that too doesn\u2019t make things right, as Politico rightly notes. \u201cThe fact that Clinton\u2019s emails were not a part of official State Department records until recently means many of them would not have been located in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, subpoenas or other document searches conducted over the past six years,\u201d explains Josh Gerstein.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02c04235215b082e2c2"}}
