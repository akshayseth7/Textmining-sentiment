Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became the first female graduates of the U.S. Army Ranger School. Beyond the dozens of pounds of weight expected to be carried by the course\u2019s grads, these women shouldered an extra burden as they struggled to change gender expectations and break the \u201ccamo\u201d ceiling.\n\nGriest, who has served as a military police platoon leader, and Haver, who was a pilot on an Apache attack helicopter in an aviation brigade, entered Ranger School with 17 other women but were the only two to complete it (one more is repeating a prior phase), although not without serious setbacks and renewed determination. Even after the women were sent back to repeat parts of the training, they continued on successfully to complete the grueling nine-week course, which, according to the Atlantic, is known as the most \u201cphysically and mentally demanding program in the Army.\u201d And if you want a peek into what earning that Ranger Tab really means, the magazine on Friday published the extreme requirements it demands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGriest\u2019s and Haver\u2019s accomplishments are significant in their own right, but what is especially heartening is the generational connection they feel to the women who will follow them. At their press conferences and interviews this week, the women, who are in their mid-20s, commented on their unique historical place and how it will affect future servicewomen.\n\nAccording to NPR, Griest said those thoughts inspired her. \u201cI was thinking really of future generations of women, that I would like them to have that opportunity so I had that pressure on myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not letting people down that I knew believed in me, people that were supporting me.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s success also speaks to how quickly minds can be changed about gender roles. While some of their male counterparts were initially skeptical, they grew to respect their female colleagues.\n\nThe New York Times printed testimonies by some of the men in their training:\n\nSecond Lt. Zachary Hagner said his mind \u201ccompletely changed\u201d one day as he was growing weary of carrying a heavy machine gun, and others in his group would not help. But Captain Griest stepped in.\n\n\u201cNine guys were like, \u2018I\u2019m too broken, I\u2019m too tired.\u2019 She was just as broken and tired, and took it from me almost with excitement,\u201d Lieutenant Hagner said.\n\nAnother one of their colleagues, 2nd Lt. Michael V. Janowski, praised Haver for her strength and trustworthyness:\n\n\u201cNo matter how bad she was hurting, she was always the first to volunteer to grab more weight,\u201d Lieutenant Janowski said. \u201cI wrote about how I would trust her with my life.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf23204235215b082e444"}}
