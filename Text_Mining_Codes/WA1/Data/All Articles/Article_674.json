The FBI has also taken thumb drives containing copies of Clinton\u2019s emails from Clinton lawyer David Kendall after determining they contained classified information. The decision to relinquish the server comes as the now-presidential candidate tries to tamp down criticism that she intentionally used the private email account to sidestep transparency requirements while attempting to address security concerns that the server may contain classified information.\n\n\n\nClinton \"directed her team to give her email server that was used during her tenure as (Secretary of State) to the Department of Justice, as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails already provided to the State Department,\" a Clinton spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday. \"She pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1af04235215b082e3f9"}}
