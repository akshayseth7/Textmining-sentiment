Martin O\u2019Malley had \u2013 on NPR, of all places \u2013 referred to Marco Rubio\u2019s economic worldview as \u201cbullshit.\u201d The interview was interesting for other, better reasons, and it was actually fairly rich in policy detail, which I\u2019ll get into in a moment, but I do want to carve out a special appreciation for the act of going on public radio as a potential candidate for the nation\u2019s highest office and letting rip with a little salty language.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s people are presenting it as a spontaneous moment of real-keeping and are actually fundraising off of \u201cbullshit,\u201d which is itself a wry commentary on the subject matter of a typical fundraising email. And because I want the rest of the world to sink to my level, it\u2019s my fervent hope that O\u2019Malley has touched off something of a linguistic race-to-the-bottom and now we\u2019ll see Hillary Clinton tell Wolf Blitzer that Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan is a \u201cturd waffle,\u201d or something similarly juvenile.\n\nBut what I like most about O\u2019Malley dismissing Rubio\u2019s economic outlook as \u201cbullshit\u201d is that he\u2019s not wrong. NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep had asked O\u2019Malley about Rubio\u2019s views on how regulations on businesses impact upward mobility, which Rubio had laid out in an NPR interview a week earlier. In that interview, Rubio tried making a populist case for deregulation, arguing that regulations only serve to stack the deck in favor of banks and large corporations. \u201cThe fact is that big government helps the people who have made it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIf you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, you\u2019ll benefit. And so that\u2019s why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s complete, well, \u201cbullshit.\u201d Republicans like Marco Rubio evangelize deregulation not because it\u2019ll give a leg up to the little guy, but because that\u2019s exactly what banks and big businesses (and the wealthy political donors who run them) prefer as a policy outcome. There\u2019s a rich historical record of deregulation broadening the gap between the wealthy and the non-wealthy, and someone who argues otherwise is, in fact, bullshitting you.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf23404235215b082e445"}}
