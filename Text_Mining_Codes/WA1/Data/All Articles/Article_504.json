RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, a Starbucks executive with the baffling title \u201cDirector, Espresso and Brewed Coffee Americas,\u201d wrote a blog post with the headline, \u201cBig News for the Beloved Pumpkin Spice Latte.\u201d The big news is that when the Pumpkin Spice Latte returns to Starbucks outlets for a limited time this fall, it will be made with a different recipe. Now, for the first time, the Pumpkin Spice Latte will contain actual pumpkin.\n\nL.V. Anderson L.V. Anderson is a Slate associate editor. She edits Slate's food and drink sections and writes Brow Beat's recipe column, You\u2019re Doing It Wrong.\n\nThis is a terrible idea for two reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe first is that, in making this change, Starbucks is capitulating to a fear-mongering food blogger whom we\u2019d all be better off ignoring. Public awareness that Pumpkin Spice Lattes contain no actual pumpkin has been percolating for years\u2014see, for instance, this 2012 essay by Felix Salmon, which acknowledges \u201cthat pumpkin dishes don\u2019t even need any actual pumpkin in them in order to cash in on the warming, autumnal vibe,\u201d or this 2013 video by the New York Times\u2019 flavor expert Michael Moss, which blows open \u201cthe industry\u2019s biggest secret: there often is little or no actual pumpkin\u201d in pumpkin-flavored foods and drinks. For a while, this was just a fun factoid about the dystopian, consumerist, David Foster Wallace-esque world we inhabit, but no one really cared that there was no pumpkin in the PSL. After all, no one orders a sweetened latte under the belief that they\u2019re getting a nourishing serving of vegetables.\n\nThen, last year, Vani Hari, a wildly popular blogger known as the Food Babe who gained a following by stoking irrational fears about GMOs and \u201ctoxins\u201d in foods, wrote a blog post about all the ostensible dangers of drinking PSLs, dangers like \u201cpreservatives and sulfites\u201d and non-organic milk. One ingredient singled out by the Food Babe may actually be hazardous\u2014caramel coloring is definitely carcinogenic in mice, which makes some scientists think it\u2019s carcinogenic in humans, too. (Starbucks announced this week that they\u2019re cutting caramel coloring from the PSL, too.) But most of the Food Babe\u2019s outrage was misplaced, and her shock that there\u2019s \u201cno real pumpkin\u201d in a PSL would be cute if it weren\u2019t accompanied by so much nonsense about imaginary risks.\n\nSo it\u2019s disappointing that Starbucks is adding pumpkin to its PSL to appease an influential but misguided kook. But that\u2019s not the only reason adding pumpkin to the PSL is a bad idea. It\u2019s a bad idea because pumpkin\u2014and here I\u2019m talking about pumpkin, the unadulterated gourd flesh\u2014doesn\u2019t taste good.\n\nAs Salmon wrote in 2012, \u201cPumpkin, on its own, is not a very appetizing food at all.\u201d He called it \u201cdense and stringy\u201d; I\u2019d add earthy, vegetal, and sometimes bitter. The only reason pumpkin pie tastes delicious is that it has lots of dairy, sugar, and spices in it\u2014the pumpkin is only there for texture, color, and bragging rights. The PSL already has dairy, sugar, and spices in it\u2014and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so popular! It\u2019s all the flavor of pumpkin pie with none of the bulk. Adding something potentially distasteful to a beloved concoction is only asking for trouble. And if Starbucks has added such a tiny amount of pumpkin puree to its recipe that it doesn\u2019t affect the flavor at all, well, that\u2019s silly.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0c604235215b082e34f"}}
