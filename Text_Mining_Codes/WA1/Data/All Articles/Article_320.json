Cal\u00e7ada\n\nIt\u2019s time to take a step out into the greater Universe in Crash Course Astronomy. Sure, exoplanets and brown dwarfs got us out of the solar system, but when you want to understand what\u2019s going on in the cosmos, you have to look at stars.\n\nWe dipped into them in Episode 26, but now it\u2019s time to start poking into their guts in detail. The basic events in any star\u2019s life occur in low mass stars, ones from red dwarfs up to a few times the mass of Sun. Things get different when higher mass stars start to die, so we\u2019ll hit that when we get into that end of the HR diagram (what\u2019s that, you ask? Click the Episode 26 link!).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn Episode 29, \u201cLow Mass Stars\u201d, I talk about their lives and deaths. Mind you, since the Sun is in that range, well, we\u2019ll have to look that eventuality in the face as well. And since the Earth orbits the Sun, you can guess what that means for our fair world.\n\nThe good news is that the events that will unfold won\u2019t do so for billions of years. Billions, with a b. We\u2019ve come a long way in the past century or two \u2014 heck, we understand stars well enough to make educational videos about them \u2014 so who knows where we\u2019ll be in a hundred million centuries.\n\nPhil Plait Phil Plait writes Slate\u2019s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!\n\nIn my book, Death from the Skies!, I cover all this, including the death of the Sun and likely vaporization of Earth. I also talk about the idea of using the gravitational effects of slinging thousands of big asteroids past the Earth to move its orbit out so that it can maintain a constant temperature while the Sun goes red giant. There\u2019s a great journal paper about this online; if you want details they\u2019re there. It\u2019s what I based that part of the chapter on.\n\nSee? There\u2019s hope! And if we\u2019re being honest, my biggest hope is that we won\u2019t need to do this to save the Earth at all. By then, instead, we\u2019ll have spread out into the galaxy, and those beyond. A billion years is a long time.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf00204235215b082e297"}}
