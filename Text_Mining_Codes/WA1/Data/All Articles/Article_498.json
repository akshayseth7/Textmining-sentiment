We are in the midst of re-evaluating our lease rules to provide yellow drivers with this kind of flexibility.\u201d\n\nGus Kodogiannis, who opened McGuinness Management almost 30 years ago, said: \u201cHonestly, yes, it\u2019s Uber. We\u2019ve lost 40% of our business in the last year and a half.\u201d\n\nUber waged a public battle against New York City mayor Bill de Blasio last month after he proposed a bill to limit the growth of for-hire vehicle companies such as Uber and Lyft.\n\nTo fight the proposed legislation, Uber pulled no punches. The company, which has a history of being far from conflict-averse, aggressively marketed itself as a service for minorities and outer-borough residents (two groups taxis are notoriously bad at serving) and as a means for New Yorkers to find gainful employment.\n\nNew York City is one of Uber\u2019s largest markets; the company generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue there.\n\nYou can read Gothamist\u2019s full story about the growing number of parked taxis in Greenpoint here.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0c304235215b082e349"}}
