He told Marketing at the time that the ad purposely avoided images of excessive consumerism.\n\nCreated by Lowe London again, the ads showed a series of portrait-style tableaux featuring people from varying demographic and ethnic groups, interspersed with images of their perfect gifts. The action is set to a cover of The Beatles\u2019 'From Me to You'.\n\n2009: Adam & Eve makes its John Lewis debut\n\nA folk cover of Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 'Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine' accompanied the first John Lewis Christmas TV campaign by Adam & Eve.\n\nThe \u00a35m ad campaign depicted children opening gifts intended for adults, such as a laptop and slippers. The final scene depicted a girl becoming a woman.\n\nThe campaign, which relaunched its 'Never Knowingly Undersold' customer proposition, had an increased emphasis on narrative offering a hint at how the retailer\u2019s Christmas ads would develop.\n\nThis year's effort helped drive a Christmas period sales increase of 12.7% on the previous year.\n\n2010: rocking horse\n\nIn February 2010, Inglis\u2019 contribution to John Lewis\u2019 marketing was recognised by his promotion to director of marketing, nearly a year after marketing director Gill Barr left the company as part of management cutbacks. Not long after, 'She's always a woman' hit the screens for its spring campaign.\n\nLater that year, the retailer unveiled a 60-second Christmas ad comprising several vignettes depicting people wrapping presents for loved ones, with one scene showing parents in the background sneaking a rocking horse upstairs while their children watched TV.\n\nUp-and-coming British singer Ellie Goulding covered Elton John\u2019s 'Your Song' for the ad, which to date has garnered 908,000 hits on John Lewis\u2019 YouTube channel.\n\n2011: The long wait\n\n2011 was the year that John Lewis went epic, with a beautifully-shot 90-second ad called \"The long wait\". It starred a boy counting down the days to Christmas so that he could give his parents a present.\n\nSet to the melancholic tones of a female singer covering The Smiths\u2019 'Please Please Let Me Get What I Want', the ad saw John Lewis and agency Adam & Eve embrace the full-blown narrative approach to advertising, with almost Spielberg-scale schmaltz.\n\nThe strategy paid off, with the ad proving massively successful online \u2013 within days of its launch it had passed the 1m mark online, while today its total views on YouTube stands at 5.2m.\n\nSales also mirrored the ad\u2019s popularity \u2013 up 9.3% year on year to \u00a3596m in the five weeks to December 2011.\n\n2012: snowpeople in love\n\nLove was again the beating heart of John Lewis\u2019 Christmas campaign in 2012, despite the ad\u2019s lead characters being far from warm-blooded.\n\nIn the 90-second spot by Adam & EveDDB, a snowman goes on a quest from the country to a John Lewis store in the city to buy a hat, gloves and scarf for his snowwoman-lover, with the outcome witnessed by a young girl looking out of her bedroom window on Christmas morning.\n\nThe action takes place with another female crooning a minor key version of a popular hit \u2013 this time Frankie Goes to Hollywood \u2019s 'The Power of Love'.\n\nThe ad again made a significant impact, accounting for an overall year-on-year sales increase for John Lewis of 44.3% in the five weeks to Christmas and helping online channel Johnlewis.com break through the \u00a3800m mark in sales.\n\nThe ad was not as popular online as 2011\u2019s 'The long wait'; although it drew a far-from-paltry 3.5m views on YouTube.\n\n2013: The Bear and the Hare\n\nRumours about the creative were drip-fed to a ravenous public (and media), including that the ad would be accompanied by a cover of Keane\u2019s 'Somewhere Only We Know' by Lily Allen.\n\nAfter ITV viewers gained a sneak preview during the channel's 'Agatha Christie's Poirot', when an animated image of a bear was shown with the hashtag #sleepingbear, the following morning saw the full epic ad revealed and it sent Twitter into meltdown. Again. The ad surpassed its predecessors and went on to become the retailer's most popular campaign across all measures.\n\n2014 - Monty the Penguin\n\nLittle boy Sam finds a partner for his best friend, Monty the Penguin.
