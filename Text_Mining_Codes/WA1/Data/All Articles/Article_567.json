Instead of being buried underground, certain types of waste stream from consumer\u2019s homes to special facilities to be sorted by type, broken down, and shipped off to manufacturers to begin life anew. Recycling makes environmental and economic sense.\n\nOr at least, it did. Sure, Americans are recycling more than ever before, but the business side of things is in a lull. Some recycled goods just aren\u2019t worth as much as they used to be, and the downturn has hit the industry hard. Companies have reported losses in the millions, some have shuttered facilities, and several are talking about renegotiating contracts so cities help foot the bill. There\u2019s no easy solution. But it sure would help if Americans relearned how to recycle.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Listen, you don\u2019t know how to recycle:\n\n\u201cI just think we need to be focusing more on the education.\u201d \u2014 Amy Perlmutter, Perlmutter Associates, a recycling consulting firm.\n\n\u201cIt always goes back to education.\u201d \u2014 Steve Sargent, director of Rumpke Recycling.\n\n\u201cMaybe a better way to look is if we can better educate everybody that what they can put in their bin is recyclables that would be better.\u201d \u2014 Jason Pelz, vice president of recycling projects with the Carton Council of North America.\n\nHow the heck do you mess up recycling?\n\nSelling out\n\nIt\u2019s best to start from the other side, the output. Recycled goods are used to make new products. That means they have to compete in commodities markets, and right now those markets aren\u2019t doing so hot. \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the longest historic drop in commodities values in the residential recycling market,\u201d says Sargent, of Rumpke. In the last five years, the average price for all the recyclables Rumpke sells back to the market has dropped from $140 to $70 or less.\n\nAluminum is down. Paper is down. Plastics are down. The whole industry is down. In its second quarter earnings statement, recycling industry behemoth Waste Management posted a $59 million loss. And just like in any business, the best way to solve that is leaner operations. The company has closed down several sorting plants. Them\u2019s the breaks.\n\nOn top of that, second hand commodities is a buyer\u2019s market, which means the goods have to be top quality. But recyclables that aren\u2019t well sorted become contaminated\u2014flattened pieces of plastic getting mixed in with the paper, for instance. So sorting plants, where all the things you throw into your recycling bins get conveyer-ed into various categories, compressed, and baled for sale, are crucial. Sorting plants are formally known as materials recovery facilities\u2014or \u201cmurfs\u201d (MRFs) if you\u2019re in the biz. Go ahead and giggle. I did.\n\nCross contamination in these plants is a big problem, so much so that some have tried to trace back all of recycling\u2019s issues to the ubiquitous blue bin. \u201cSingle stream recycling results in a doubling of contamination rates,\u201d says Susan Robinson, Waste Management\u2019s director of public affairs. But it also gets more people to participate, which is the main reason why fewer and fewer cities are asking you to sort. In the end, the big blue bin is still boss.\n\nBut sorting\u2019s biggest menace isn\u2019t cross-contamination, it\u2019s non-recyclables that come along for the ride. \u201cThe single biggest problem material at recycling facilities are plastic bags,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cWe get a surprising number of garden hoses, Christmas lights, and shower curtains,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cAll those materials wrap around equipment, sometimes for hours,\u201d resulting in hours of lost productivity while the material is fished out.\n\nIt\u2019s not even that people are being lazy. Rather, Americans are in some ways too enthusiastic about recycling. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned is that people do a lot of wishful recycling, where folks want so bad to recycle so they throw things in by default,\u201d says Anderson.\n\nWhich means it\u2019s the recycling industry that\u2019s not doing a good enough job at letting people know what is not allowed. Part of this is messaging. \u201cSure, plastic bags can technically be recycled, by taking them back to the supermarket,\u201d says Amy Perlmutter, the recycling consultant. But she says a lot of people think it\u2019s equally OK to put them in the bin. Likewise, the recycle symbol on the bottom of your plastic soda bottle is a code so manufacturers know where the bottle came from, not instructions for you about where to put it when it\u2019s empty.\n\nAdded to the mixed messages are absent messaging. Hoses and shower curtains are plastic, too, so hey why not? And Christmas lights are\u2026 Ok, c\u2019mon seriously who\u2019s putting fricking Christmas lights in the recycle bin?\n\nSorting right\n\nWhich brings us back to you, the American who needs a recycling reeducation. Company after company, spokesperson after spokesperson, all told me that they were toiling away at how to keep consumers up to date on what is and is not allowed in the bin. The industry is focused on educating consumers, because their livelihood depends on it. They mentioned fliers, newspaper ads, websites, and social media, but none had a good way to reach you, nor did they have a comprehensive list of what-is-or-is-not-recyclable. Why aren\u2019t you getting the message?\n\nPartly, because what-is-or-is-not-recyclable is always changing. Some of this is market driven. \u201cMy job would be so much easier if every couple of months I wasn\u2019t telling people \u2018Oh no that\u2019s not recyclable anymore because the market has changed\u2019,\u201d says Tony Hair, Portland State University\u2019s waste management coordinator.\n\nAnd some of it is geographic, because every community has different standards for what can and can\u2019t be recycled. \u201cI think a standardized, nationwide list of what\u2019s recyclable would be great, but every community is different,\u201d says Derric Brown, vice president of sustainability at the Carton Council (PROTIP: Don\u2019t crush your cartons before you recycle them, otherwise they\u2019ll get sorted in with normal paper!)\n\nThe recycling industry is justifiably concerned about how to keep their profits intact. But you should care, too, and not just for environmental reasons. Those recycling economics could come full circle, back to you. In many places, recycling is part of the cultural identity. In many others, it\u2019s the law. Even in the worst case scenario\u2014commodity values stayed low, contamination rates high\u2014cities won\u2019t abandon the practice. Instead, they\u2019ll have to help with the bottom line.\n\nAlready, Waste Management and Rumpke have renegotiated contracts with some cities where commodities sales are no longer offsetting operating costs. \u201cWho is going to pay that cost? It\u2019s going to be the government through taxes,\u201d says Jerry Powell, executive editor of Resource Recycling, an industry magazine. And in some places, these costs will go directly to rate payers, depending on how much they recycle.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just up to you to get smarter. The recycling industry at large is still relying on low tech gadgets like magnets, fans, and human hands to sort the myriad\u2014and changing\u2014streams of recyclable waste. The biggest trend in modernization is new technology, like optical scanners. Which should help sort out all your bad recycling habits, even if you don\u2019t manage to unlearn them.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0fc04235215b082e38e"}}
