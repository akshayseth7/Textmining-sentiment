Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images.\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s decision not to run for president comes as a blow. In a statement released on Monday, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee explained that his work as the newly minted chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee \u201cdeserves undivided attention\u201d and that he could do more for the country in that role than as a presidential candidate. For now, at least, there will be no more talk of \u201cRyan for Rushmore.\u201d\n\nEver since Ryan was first elected in 1998, a grim year for Republicans, the former think-tanker has been a one-man policy innovation machine. But during President Obama\u2019s first term, he became something more than that. In effect, Ryan became the leader of the opposition, in spirit if not in name, fighting against Obamacare and for fiscal restraint. He managed to unite risk-averse House Republicans around a controversial Medicare reform proposal. After Republicans won back the House in 2010, Ryan took the helm at the House Budget Committee, and he used its considerable resources to weigh in on income inequality and entrenched poverty. Ryan might not have won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination had he decided to run\u2014he didn\u2019t exactly set the world on fire as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012\u2014but the field would have been stronger with him in it. He would have been the candidate of ideas and would have pressed his Republican rivals to think seriously about upward mobility and the need to modernize America\u2019s safety net, among other issues conservatives tend to neglect.\n\nYet there is a silver lining in Ryan\u2019s decision not to run, which is highlighted by the sweeping tax overhaul just proposed by House Democrats. Though Ryan is more open-minded and intellectually serious than we have any right to expect from an elected official, on tax policy, at least, he\u2019s failed to come to terms with how the country has changed. A supply-sider to the bitter end, Ryan has made it clear that his first priority in reforming the tax code is to lower tax rates for everyone, including high-earners. In a conversation this summer with John McCormack of the Weekly Standard, Ryan insisted that \u201cthe best way to help the economy is to reduce rates across the board\u201d and that \u201cif you want faster growth, more upward mobility, and faster job creation,\u201d lower tax rates are \u201cthe secret sauce.\u201d Well, this is a secret sauce that is past its expiration date.\n\nThe Democrats are upping their game while Ryan seems stuck in the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Like Ryan, I favor lower tax rates. I just don\u2019t believe that lower tax rates for high-earners should be our highest tax reform priority. In Room to Grow, an essay collection from the conservative YG Network, Robert Stein, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, explains why across-the-board cuts should no longer be seen as a cure-all. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes, the top rate was 70 percent. Right now, it is 39.6 percent. In other words, today\u2019s top rate is much, much lower than it was in the bad old days. Granted, this isn\u2019t the whole story, as high-earners face a number of other levies that didn\u2019t exist in earlier years (like the ultra-stealthy Unearned Income Medicare Contribution) while several tax shelters that were available in the late 1970s have since been swept away. Moreover, the state and local taxes faced by high-earners are generally much higher now than they were in the Carter years. But it\u2019s hard to deny that incentives for high-earners to work, save, and invest are stronger now than they were when Reagan came on the scene (for which Reagan deserves credit). It shouldn\u2019t be too shocking that cutting a 70 percent top marginal tax rate to 50 percent had a big effect. Cutting a 39.6 percent top rate a few percentage points isn\u2019t going to make nearly as big a difference.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeffb04235215b082e28e"}}
