{"URL": "http://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2015/daily/nyff53-special-events-and-revivals-revealed/", "Text": "Everything in the New York Film Festival is special, but we\u2019re particularly excited about the lineups for this year\u2019s Special Events and Revivals sections. The former includes important new works and premieres, as well as an anniversary celebration of a beloved musical fantasia. The latter includes 11 international masterpieces from renowned filmmakers whose diverse and eclectic works have been digitally remastered, restored, and preserved with the assistance of generous partners, including Martin Scorsese\u2019s Film Foundation, celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nThe Special Events lineup returns with Film Comment Presents, originally launched during NYFF in 2013 with the premiere of the award-winning 12 Years a Slave. This year\u2019s selection, Son of Saul, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s shattering film about the horror of Auschwitz, recently won the Grand Prix at Cannes, and has been selected as Hungary\u2019s official entry for the foreign-language film category of the Academy Awards. Making its North American Premiere in the festival is Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow\u2019s film portrait De Palma, chronicling director Brian De Palma\u2019s illustrious six-decade-long career, his life, and his personal views on the filmmaking process (De Palma\u2019s masterful Blow Out will also screen in Revivals). Another established American filmmaker turning his attention from narrative to intimate documentary study is Paul Thomas Anderson, whose latest film, Junun, will World Premiere in the Special Events section. Junun follows the musical journey of his close friend and collaborator Jonny Greenwood to northern India, to record an album with an Israeli musician Shye Ben Tzur and illustrious local musicians.\n\nAdditional highlights include renowned artist Laurie Anderson (this year\u2019s NYFF poster designer!) who will premiere her first feature in 30 years, a personal essay entitled Heart of a Dog. Anderson\u2019s response to a commission from Arte, the film is a work of braided joy and heartbreak and remembering and forgetting, at the heart of which is a lament for her late beloved piano-playing and finger-painting dog Lolabelle. The recently announced NYFF Filmmaker in Residence, Athina Rachel Tsangari, will also present her latest film, Chevalier, which will be making its U.S. Premiere fresh on the heels of the Locarno and Toronto International Film Festivals.\n\nFollowing the NYFF tradition of special anniversary screenings (which in the past have included The Princess Bride\u2019s 25th anniversary, This Is Spinal Tap\u2019s 30th anniversary, and Dazed and Confused\u2019s 20th anniversary), the festival is proud to present a special evening celebrating the 15th anniversary of Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s beloved roots-musical fantasia O Brother, Where Art Thou?, set in the rural south in the 1930s and based on Homer\u2019s The Odyssey. The Coen Brothers and cast members will be on hand for this journey, and there will be a special musical performance.\n\nThe Revivals selection for this year\u2019s festival includes a diverse group of 11 international offerings from master filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa, Brian De Palma, Hou Hsiao-hsien, King Hu, Manoel de Oliveira, and more. These restorations include a suite of movies that have been restored with the assistance of Martin Scorsese\u2019s nonprofit Film Foundation. Established in 1990, the Foundation has helped to save, protect, and preserve over 700 films, working in partnership with archives and studios from around the globe. This year\u2019s Revivals section includes seven films restored with the Foundation\u2019s help: Ousmane Sembene\u2019s Black Girl, Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s The Boys from Fengkuei, Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s Heaven Can Wait, Lino Brocka\u2019s Insiang, John Ford\u2019s The Long Voyage Home, Marcel Oph\u00fcls\u2019 The Memory of Justice, and Luchino Visconti\u2019s Rocco and His Brothers. The Lubitsch film will be screened in a new 35mm print, courtesy of 20th Century Fox.\n\nNot to be missed is Akira Kurosawa\u2019s astonishing Ran, the NYFF\u2019s 1985 Opening Night selection, returning to the festival in a newly restored version, where the color palette is unlike that of any other movie made before or since. King Hu\u2019s three-years-in-the-making masterpiece, A Touch of Zen, will also be shown in a beautiful restoration, which was presented at this year\u2019s edition of Cannes, 40 years after the film\u2019s first unveiling to Western eyes. The late, great Manoel de Oliveira\u2019s 1982 film Visit, or Memories and Confessions will also be included in the Revivals lineup this year, after having been hidden away from audiences by the filmmaker himself for over 30 years.\n\nTickets for the General Public go on sale Sunday, September 13.

As in her 2010 breakthrough, Attenberg, Athina Rachel Tsangari, the New York Film Festival\u2019s 2015 Filmmaker in Residence, balances anthropological precision with a wry and wholly original sense of humor. Impeccably staged, crisply photographed, and buoyed by eclectic soundtrack choices (Petula Clark, Mark Lanegan), this maritime psychodrama becomes both funnier and richer in its implications as it progresses. What begins as a lampoon of bourgeois machismo and male anxiety develops into an incisive allegory for the state of contemporary Greece, and leaves a final impression as an empathetic, razor-sharp study of human nature itself. The Filmmaker in Residence program was launched in 2013 by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Jaeger-LeCoultre as an annual initiative designed to support filmmakers at an early stage in the creative process against the backdrop of New York City and the New York Film Festival (NYFF). U.S. Premiere\n\nDe Palma\n\nNoah Baumbach & Jake Paltrow, USA, 2015, DCP, 107m\n\nNoah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow\u2019s fleet and bountiful portrait covers the career of the number one iconoclast of American cinema, the man who gave us Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, and Carlito\u2019s Way. Their film moves at the speed of De Palma\u2019s thought (and sometimes works in subtle, witty counterpoint) as he goes title by title, covering his life from science nerd to New Hollywood bad boy to grand old man, and describes his ever-shifting position in this thing we call the movie business. Deceptively simple, De Palma is finally many things at once. It is a film about the craft of filmmaking\u2014how it\u2019s practiced and how it can be so easily distorted and debased. It\u2019s an insightful and often hilarious tour through American moviemaking from the 1960s to the present, and a primer on how movies are made and unmade. And it\u2019s a surprising, lively, and unexpectedly moving portrait of a great, irascible, unapologetic, and uncompromising New York artist. In conjunction with this film, we will also be showing De Palma\u2019s masterpiece Blow Out. North American Premiere\n\nHeart of a Dog\n\nLaurie Anderson, USA/France, 2015, DCP, 75m\n\nIn Laurie Anderson\u2019s plainspoken all-American observational-autobiographical art, voices and harmonies and rhythms and images are juxtaposed and layered, metaphors are generated, and the mind of the viewer/listener is sent spinning into the stratosphere. It\u2019s been nine years since her last film and almost 30 since her last feature. Heart of a Dog is her response to a commission from Arte, a work of braided joy and heartbreak and remembering and forgetting, at the heart of which is a lament for her late beloved piano-playing and finger-painting dog Lolabelle. Life in the neighborhood\u2014downtown New York after 9/11\u2026 the archiving of surveillance records in ziggurat-like structures\u2026 Lolabelle\u2019s passage through the bardo\u2026 recollections of deaths and near-deaths, terrors personal and global, sad goodbyes and funny ones, dreams and imagined flights\u2026 acceptance: Heart of a Dog is as immediate as a paragraph by Kerouac, as disarmingly playful as a Cole Porter melody, as rhapsodically composed as a poem by Whitman, and a thing of rare beauty.\n\nJunun\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, USA, 2015, DCP, 54m\n\nEnglish, Hindu, Hebrew, and Urdu with English subtitles\n\nEarlier this year, Paul Thomas Anderson joined his close friend and collaborator Jonny Greenwood on a trip to Rajasthan in northwest India, where they were hosted by the Maharaja of Jodhpur, and he brought his camera with him. Their destination was the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort, where Greenwood (with the help of Radiohead engineer Nigel Godrich) was recording an album with Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and an amazing group of musicians: Aamir Bhiyani, Soheb Bhiyani, Ajaj Damami, Sabir Damami, Hazmat, and Bhanwaru Khan on brass; Ehtisham Khan Ajmeri, Nihal Khan, Nathu Lal Solanki, Narsi Lal Solanki, and Chugge Khan on percussion; Zaki Ali Qawwal, Zakir Ali Qawwal, Afshana Khan, Razia Sultan, Gufran Ali, and Shazib Ali on vocals; and Dara Khan and Asin Khan on strings. The finished film, just under an hour, is pure magic. Junun lives and breathes music, music-making, and the close camaraderie of artistic collaboration. It\u2019s a lovely impressionistic mosaic and a one-of-a-kind sonic experience: the music will blow your mind. World Premiere\n\nAnniversary Screening:\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen, 2000, USA, DCP, 107m\n\nThis year marks the 15th anniversary of Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s beloved roots-musical fantasia, \u201cbased upon The Odyssey, by Homer,\u201d about three escaped convicts (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro) trying to get back home in the rural South of the 1930s. Bigger than life, endlessly surprising, eye-popping (\u201cthey wanted it to look like an old hand-tinted picture,\u201d said DP Roger Deakins), and as giddily and defiantly unclassifiable as all other Coen films, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is, among many other things, a celebration of American music. With a score curated and produced by T-Bone Burnett, the movie sings with voices and sounds of some of the best musicians in the country, including Ralph Stanley, the Fairfield Four, Alison Krauss, John Hartford, Emmylou Harris, and Gillian Welch, and the melodies of classics like \u201cBig Rock Candy Mountain,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away,\u201d and the film\u2019s touchstone, \u201cMan of Constant Sorrow.\u201d Cast members, musical guests, and Joel and Ethan Coen will be on hand. Bring your instrument! A Touchstone Pictures and Universal Pictures release.\n\nFilm Comment Presents:\n\nSon of Saul\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, Hungary, 2015, 35mm, 107m\n\nHungarian and German with English subtitles\n\nA film that looks into the abyss, this shattering portrait of the horror of Auschwitz follows Saul (G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig), a Sonderkommando tasked with delivering his fellow Jews to the gas chamber. Determined to give a young boy a proper Jewish burial, Saul descends through the death camp\u2019s circles of Hell, while a rebellion brews among the prisoners. A bombshell debut from director and co-writer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, Son of Saul is an utterly harrowing, ultra-immersive experience, and not for the fainthearted. With undeniably virtuoso plan-s\u00e9quence camerawork in the mode of Nemes\u2019s teacher B\u00e9la Tarr, this startling film represents a new benchmark in the historic cinematic depictions of the Holocaust. A deeply troubling work, sure to be one of the year\u2019s most controversial films. A Sony Pictures Classics release.\n\nRevivals\n\nBlow Out\n\nBrian De Palma, USA, 1981, 35mm, 107m\n\nOne of Brian De Palma\u2019s greatest films and one of the great American films of the 1980s, Blow Out is such a hallucinatory, emotionally and visually commanding experience that the term \u201cthriller\u201d seems insufficient. De Palma takes a variety of elements\u2014the Kennedy assassination; Chappaquiddick; Antonioni\u2019s Blow-Up; the slasher genre that was then in full flower; elements of Detective Bob Leuci\u2019s experiences working undercover for the Knapp Commission; the harshness and sadness of American life; and, as ever, Hitchcock\u2019s Vertigo\u2014and swirls and mixes them into a film that builds to a truly shattering conclusion. With John Travolta, in what is undoubtedly his greatest performance, as the sound man for low-budget movies who accidentally records a murder; Nancy Allen, absolutely heartbreaking, as the girl caught in the middle; John Lithgow as the hired killer; and De Palma stalwart Dennis Franz as the world\u2019s biggest sleaze. This was the second of three collaborations between De Palma and the master DP Vilmos Zsigmond. MGM Home Entertainment.\n\nRan\n\nAkira Kurosawa, Japan/France, 1985, DCP, 160m\n\nJapanese with English subtitles\n\nThe 1985 New York Film Festival opened with Akira Kurosawa\u2019s astonishing medieval epic, inspired by the life of Mori Motonari, a 16th-century warlord with three sons. It was only after he began writing that the filmmaker started to see parallels with King Lear. It took a decade for Kurosawa to bring his grand conception to the screen\u2014he actually painted storyboards of every shot along the way, and made another great film, Kagemusha, as a dry run. The finished work he eventually gave us was, to put it mildly, a mind-blowing experience. Tatsuya Nakadai is the warlord, Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu, and Daisuke Ryu are his sons, Mieko Harada is the terrifying Lady Kaede, the score is by Toru Takemitsu, but the dominant force looming over every single element of this film, down to the smallest detail, is Kurosawa himself. The color palette of Ran is unlike that of any other movie made before or since, as you\u2019ll see in this newly restored version. Restoration by StudioCanal with the participation of Kadokawa Pictures. A Rialto Pictures release.\n\nA Touch of Zen\n\nKing Hu, Hong Kong, 1971/75, DCP, 200m\n\nMandarin with English subtitles\n\nWhen it comes to the wuxia film, all roads lead back to the great King Hu: supreme fantasist, Ming dynasty scholar, and incomparable artist. For years, Hu labored on his own, creating one exquisitely crafted film after another (with astonishing pre-CGI visual effects), elevating the martial-arts genre to unparalleled heights and, as the film critic and producer Peggy Chiao noted in her obituary for Hu, single-handedly introducing Chinese cinema to the rest of the world. Hu\u2019s three-years-in-the-making masterpiece, A Touch of Zen, was released in truncated form in Hong Kong in 1971 and yanked from theaters after a week. A close-to-complete version was constructed by Hu and shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, where Hu won a grand prize for technical achievement (which earned King Hu an apology from his studio heads). This beautiful restoration of A Touch of Zen was presented at this year\u2019s edition of Cannes, 40 years after the film\u2019s first unveiling to Western eyes. Restored in 4K by L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata, with original materials provided by the Taiwan Film Institute. A Janus Films release.\n\nVisit, or Memories and Confessions\n\nManoel de Oliveira, Portugal, 1982, 35mm, 73m\n\nPortuguese with English subtitles\n\nThe late, great Manoel de Oliveira stipulated that this film\u2014made in 1982\u2014be screened publicly only after his death. One of the Portuguese master\u2019s most exquisite and moving films, and certainly his most personal, Visit assumes the rare form of an auto-elegy. A prowling camera finds Oliveira, who died at 106 this past April, in the Porto house where he had lived for four decades and that he is preparing to leave due to mounting debts. He addresses the audience directly, setting the film\u2019s droll, convivial tone, and discusses a wide range of topics (family history, cinema, architecture), shares home movies, and reenacts his run-in with the military dictatorship. Oliveira\u2019s improbable career took the form of a long goodbye, but this actual farewell is no less touching in its simplicity and lucidity. He made the film at age 73, presumably expecting he was near the end of his life. He would in fact live another 33 years and make another 25 or so films, some of them among his greatest, in an extended twilight that was also an artistic prime unlike any other. Print courtesy of Cinemateca Portuguesa. North American Premiere.\n\nCelebrating 25 Years of The Film Foundation\n\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of The Film Foundation. Following his successful campaign in the early \u201980s to develop a more durable color film stock, Martin Scorsese founded the organization to raise awareness of the fragility of film and to create a genuine consciousness of film preservation. Since its inception in 1990, TFF has partnered with archives, studios, and labs around the world to restore over 700 films. We\u2019re presenting seven of their newest restorations.\n\nBlack Girl / La Noire de\u2026\n\nOusmane Sembene, France/Senegal, 1965, DCP, 65m\n\nFrench with English subtitles\n\nOusmane Sembene\u2019s first feature\u2014really, the movie that opened the way for African cinema in the West\u2014is by turns tough, swift, and true in its aim. A young woman (Mbissine Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Diop) leaves Senegal with dreams of a more carefree and glamorous existence in France, where she procures a job as a live-in maid and nanny for a young couple in the French Riviera. She is gradually deadened by the endless routines and tasks and rhythms of life in the tiny apartment, and by the dissatisfactions felt by the husband and wife, which they project onto their \u201cblack girl.\u201d Sembene\u2019s \u201cperfect short story,\u201d wrote Manny Farber, naming it as his movie of 1969, \u201cis unlike anything in the film library: translucent and no tricks, amazingly pure, but spiritualized.\u201d A formative and eye-opening work, and one of Sembene\u2019s finest. Restored by The Film Foundation\u2019s World Cinema Project in collaboration with the Sembene Estate, Institut National de l\u2019Audiovisuel, INA, Eclair laboratories, and Centre National de Cin\u00e9matographie. Restoration carried out at Cineteca di Bologna/L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory. A Janus Films release.\n\nThe Boys from Fengkuei\n\nHou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan, 1983, DCP, 101m\n\nMandarin with English subtitles\n\nThis \u201cgroup portrait of four laddish adolescents on the razzle in Kaohsiung as they approach the onset of adult life\u201d (Tony Rayns) is Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s fourth film, but he has long considered it to be the real beginning of his career as a moviemaker. \u201cI had very intense feelings at the time,\u201d Hou told Sam Ho, \u201cand I think the film has an intense energy. An artist\u2019s early work might be lacking in craft but, at the same time, be very powerful, very direct. Later, when I wanted to return to that initial intensity, I no longer could.\u201d In the tradition of Fellini\u2019s I Vitelloni, The Boys from Fengkuei is a deeply personal look back at the director\u2019s own adolescence\u2014at the boredom of living in the middle of nowhere and the overwhelming need to get up and move, and get out and away to the big city. A glorious young-man\u2019s film, and the first great work of the Taiwanese New Wave. Restoration by the Cineteca di Bologna. A Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Royale de Belgique release.\n\nHeaven Can Wait\n\nErnst Lubitsch, USA, 1943, 35mm, 112m\n\nThe legendary Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s portrait of a turn-of-the-century hedonist extraordinaire begins at the gate of hell\u2014not Dante\u2019s Inferno but a handsome art-deco waiting room, where a courtly Satan (Laird Cregar) conducts an admission interview with the recently deceased Henry Van Cleve (Don Ameche). Henry\u2019s leisurely stroll through the past is a very funny comedy of manners and a lovely rendering of Old New York. Lubitsch\u2019s writing with Samson Raphaelson \u2014 Satan: \u201cI presume your funeral was satisfactory.\u201d Henry: \u201cWell, there was a lot of crying, so I believe everybody had a good time.\u201d\u2014and his meticulous direction are all of a piece. The film\u2019s glorious, candy-box Technicolor has now been beautifully restored by Schawn Belston and his team at 20th Century Fox, just in time for the 100th Anniversary of the Fox Film Corporation. With Gene Tierney, Louis Calhern, Eugene Pallette, Marjorie Main, and Charles Coburn as Henry\u2019s grandfather and fellow black sheep. Restored by 20th Century Fox in collaboration with the Academy Film Archive and The Film Foundation. A 20th Century Fox release.\n\nInsiang\n\nLino Brocka, Philippines, 1976, DCP, 95m\n\nTagalog and Filipino with English subtitles\n\nIn Lino Brocka\u2019s searing 1976 melodrama (one could use the same adjective to describe all of his melodramas), the eponymous heroine, played by Hilda Koronel, is raped by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, then blamed for provoking the act and forced out of her own home. \u201cInsiang is, first and foremost, a character analysis,\u201d wrote the director. \u201cI need this character to recreate the \u2018violence\u2019 stemming from urban overpopulation, to show the annihilation of a human being, the loss of human dignity caused by the physical and social environment\u2026\u201d The people in Brocka\u2019s films live in dire circumstances, offset by their extreme vitality and their electrically charged encounters. Insiang, a failure on its home ground but the first film from the Philippines to be invited to Cannes, is one of its director\u2019s best. It is also the second of Brocka\u2019s works to be restored by the World Cinema Project. With Mona Lisa as Insiang\u2019s mother. Restored in 2015 by Cineteca di Bologna/L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata. Restoration funding provided by The Film Foundation\u2019s World Cinema Project and the Film Development Council of the Philippines. A Film Foundation release.\n\nThe Long Voyage Home\n\nJohn Ford, USA, 1940, DCP, 105m\n\nIndependently produced by Walter Wanger, John Ford\u2019s soulful, heartbreaking film is based on four Eugene O\u2019Neill one-acts about life at sea (the playwright himself loved the movie so much that he acquired his own 16mm print). Ford, working with his screenwriter Dudley Nichols and his brilliant cameraman Gregg Toland (they had just collaborated on The Grapes of Wrath), updates the plays to World War II and condenses the action, creating tonal variations on the aching loneliness of life at sea and the longing for home. In the words of Ford biographer Joseph McBride, the director and his DP \u201cbroke all the rules of conventional Hollywood cinematography\u201d and created \u201ca doom-laden mood with deep pools of light and shadow\u201d\u2014seen to full advantage in this beautiful restoration. The Long Voyage Home is a true ensemble piece featuring many of the actors that comprised Ford\u2019s \u201cstock company,\u201d including Thomas Mitchell, Barry Fitzgerald and his brother Arthur Shields, John Qualen, and, unforgettably, John Wayne as the Swedish sailor Ole. Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive. Restoration funding provided by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and The Film Foundation. A Westchester Films and Shout! Factory release.\n\nThe Memory of Justice\n\nMarcel Oph\u00fcls, UK/USA/France/Germany, 1976, DCP, 278m\n\nFrench with English subtitles\n\nThe third of Marcel Oph\u00fcls\u2019 monumental inquiries into the questions of individual and collective guilt fueling the calamities of war and genocide, The Memory of Justice examines the defining tragedies of the Western world in the second half of the 20th century, from the Nuremberg trials through the French-Algerian war to the disaster of Vietnam, building from a vast range of interviews, from Telford Taylor (Counsel for the Prosecution at Nuremberg, later a harsh critic of our escalating involvement in Vietnam) to Nazi architect Albert Speer to Daniel Ellsberg and Joan Baez. As Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times when The Memory of Justice was screened at the 1976 New York Film Festival, Oph\u00fcls\u2019 film \u201cexpands the possibilities of the documentary motion picture in such a way that all future films of this sort will be compared to it.\u201d Seldom seen since its premiere and then only in rare 16mm prints, the film has now been painstakingly restored. Restored by the Academy Film Archive in association with Paramount Pictures and The Film Foundation. Restoration funding provided by The Material World Charitable Foundation, Righteous Persons Foundation, and The Film Foundation. A Film Foundation release.\n\nRocco and His Brothers\n\nLuchino Visconti, Italy/France, 1960, DCP, 177m\n\nItalian with English subtitles\n\nLuchino Visconti\u2019s rich and expansive masterpiece, the story of a mother and her grown sons who head north from Lucania in search of work and new lives, has an emotional intensity and a tragic grandeur matched by few other films. Visconti turned to Giovanni Testori, Thomas Mann, Dostoyevsky, and Arthur Miller for inspiration, and he achieved an truly epic sweep: in one beautifully realized scene after another, we observe the tragic progress of a tightly knit family coming apart, one frayed thread at a time. Alain Delon is Rocco, Renato Salvatori is his brother Simone, Annie Girardot is the woman who comes between them, and Katina Paxinou is the matriarch, Rosaria. Rocco and His Brothers, one of the great and defining films of its era, has now been beautifully restored, and Giuseppe Rotunno\u2019s black-and-white images are once again as pearly and lustrous as they were meant to be. Restored by Cineteca di Bologna/L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata in association with Titanus, TF1 Droits Audiovisuels, and The Film Foundation. Restoration funding provided by Gucci and The Film Foundation. A Milestone Film release.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee8604235215b082e1c0"}}
