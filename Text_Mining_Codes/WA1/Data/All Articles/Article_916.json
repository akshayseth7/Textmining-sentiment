Today, I have been able to climb up the social mobility ladder and be where I am thanks to opportunities available in Singapore,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"It is important to have checks and balances to make sure there is enough opportunities in the future.\"\n\nThe SPP is contesting three single-seat wards and is due to send a joint team to the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC with the Democratic Progressive Party.\n\nWith his announcement, all candidates for SMCs that SPP intends to contest have been unveiled. Mrs Chiam will be contesting Potong Pasir and Mrs Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss is being fielded in Mountbatten.\n\nBut the Bishan-Toa Payoh team that will jointly consist members of the SPP and the Democratic People's Party remains up in the air.\n\nAsked about this on Saturday, Mrs Chiam said: \"The names of these candidates will be released in due course, and you will not be disappointed.\"", "_id": {"$oid": "55dc249004235215b082e4ec"}}
