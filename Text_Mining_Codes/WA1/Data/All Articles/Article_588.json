And judging from three series currently featuring strong bisexual women, admitting an attraction to both girls and boys is the hot new signifier of confidence and independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Good Wife\u2019s Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) was the first in this latest round of bisexual heroines. Strictly speaking, Kalinda doesn\u2019t identify as bisexual\u2014or accept any other label for that matter: When then-friend and co-worker Alicia Florrick asked if she was gay, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m private.\u201d But she\u2019s been shown kissing and enjoying post-coital moments with both men and women.\n\nKalinda\u2019s sexuality is just one aspect of the air of mystery that surrounds her. Over the show\u2019s three seasons, we\u2019ve gleaned a few tidbits about her past, but there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know\u2014like her real name, or why a senior partner at the law firm where she works as in-house investigator has been handling a tax case on her behalf.\n\nKalinda is one of the most efficient characters on television\u2014she single-handedly solves a mystery at the center of the show with remarkable frequency\u2014but she hates to be pigeonholed. The only time I can recall her seeming less than omniscient was when she and then-colleague Cary Agos conducted an investigation in Little India; Cary erroneously assumed that Kalinda speaks Hindi, which left her quite flustered. She isn\u2019t a typical American desi, nor is she a typical bisexual.\n\nLike Kalinda, Bo, the central character on Lost Girl (played by Anna Silk), hates to pick sides. She grew up believing herself to be a killer kisser\u2014literally\u2014so you can imagine the relief when she learns that she isn\u2019t human. Instead, she\u2019s a supernatural seductress known as succubus, part of the Fae, who are divided into two clans, light and dark. Bo refuses to align herself with either camp, which leaves her distrusted by both groups.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, then, that she refuses to stick to just male or female sex partners. As she says in a voiceover during the opening credits, \u201cLife is hard when you don\u2019t know who you are; harder when you don\u2019t know what you are. \u2026 I will live the life I choose.\u201d Bo is involved with Dyson, a male Fae who works as a police detective, and Lauren, a female doctor who works for the Fae. They each have something different to offer her\u2014Dyson can \u201cheal\u201d her, while Lauren can help learn to calibrate her powers. Their interactions are different\u2014with Dyson the sex is wild and shrieky, while with Lauren it\u2019s all sighs and meaningful eye contact\u2014but given their differing physiologies, maybe that\u2019s more than just a recitation of clich\u00e9d ideas about heterosexual and lesbian sex.\n\nOn Showtime\u2019s House of Lies, meanwhile, being bisexual is mostly about being hot and uninhibited. April (Megalyn Echikunwoke) could be described as the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d of management consultant Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle), but that undersells her. She\u2019s a stripper, a law student, and, we learned in Episode 6, a cop killer.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf11604235215b082e3a3"}}
