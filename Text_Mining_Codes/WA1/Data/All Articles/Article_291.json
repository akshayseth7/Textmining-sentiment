Every 30 or so days, you\u2019ve shared your monthly same-store sales figures, and every 30 days or so, we\u2019ve dutifully compiled the numbers into charts to follow their rise and fall (mostly fall). We watched in December as comps in the United States peaked into positive territory for the first time in 13 months and even stayed there through January, before toppling 4 percent in February. We stood by in June as global comps dropped 0.3 percent to mark a year of consecutive declines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut in late May you told us that these rendezvous would have to end. So here we are, on the day of your second-quarter earnings report, to observe the last installment of the Monthly Misery Watch. Once again, you disappointed. U.S. comps down 1.7 percent in June. Global comps off 1.3 percent. Here\u2019s one last chart, for old time\u2019s sake:\n\nData from McDonald\u2019s. Chart by Alison Griswold.\n\n\n\nSure, we know that this is what\u2019s right for you. Your CEO, Steve Easterbrook, will get some breathing room to focus on long-term improvement instead of monthly flirtations with investors. Now that you\u2019ve ceased an out-of-date financial reporting practice (one that Walmart gave up six years ago), maybe you\u2019ll succeed in becoming a \u201cmodern, progressive burger company.\u201d Maybe you\u2019ll finally get all-day breakfast off the ground in the U.S. nationwide (as the Wall Street Journal reported could happen by October), delighting diners with near-constant access to the Egg McMuffin. Maybe you\u2019ll even stop trying stunts like \u201cPay With Lovin\u2019 .\u201d\n\nStill, what\u2019s best for you is tough for us. When August rolls around, we\u2019ll wonder how your same-store sales fared in July, and in September how they did in August. And we\u2019ve finally accepted this is really happening. When we were still in denial in late May, we consulted a top accounting firm, which assured us that companies aren\u2019t required to provide their same-store sales on a monthly basis. Yes, we\u2019ll still get some comps information in the quarterly reports, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014that\u2019s just a third as fun.\n\n\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to say is, we understand why your same-store sales are leaving us, but we\u2019re still sad to see them go. We hope you\u2019ll change your mind, but recognize that you probably won\u2019t. We\u2019ll look forward to seeing what you include next earnings cycle, in three months. Until then, it\u2019s been real.\n\nLove,", "_id": {"$oid": "55daefe104235215b082e27a"}}
