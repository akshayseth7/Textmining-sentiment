Film stills from Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, Something Wild, and Married to the Mob.\n\nThere\u2019s a story that when Paul Thomas Anderson was once asked which three directors had influenced him the most, he replied, \u201cJonathan Demme, Jonathan Demme, and Jonathan Demme.\u201d In his director\u2019s commentary for Boogie Nights, Anderson called Demme his \u201cgreatest influence style-wise.\u201d His favorite part of Demme\u2019s style? His close-ups. \u201cI always loved close-ups in movies,\u201d he says on the commentary, \u201c[and] the very first time I saw a close-up that looked exactly like I wanted a close-up to look was in Silence of the Lambs.\u201d\n\nA new supercut from editor Jacob T. Swinney (above, via Press Play) shows what makes many of Demme\u2019s close-ups special. What jumps out first is how often Demme breaks the 180-degree rule\u2014one of the most basic rules of traditional Hollywood filmmaking\u2014and instead shoots his characters center-frame, looking directly into the camera, nearly breaking the fourth wall. He also frequently uses very shallow focus, making, say, the face of Hannibal Lecter stand out even more sharply against the background. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what makes those iconic shots of Lecter so unnerving, this is a big reason why.\n\n\n\nStill from Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Magnolia \u00a9 1999 - New Line Cinema\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, Demme is not the only director to employ close-ups like this, but many who do today were directly inspired by Demme. You might see similar shots in Spike Lee\u2019s movies or Wes Anderson\u2019s. In the same commentary, PTA says he once asked Demme if he\u2019d ever recognized all \u201call those shots [he] ripped off from [him].\u201d Wes Anderson, similarly, has said that he thinks of his close-ups as \u201cjust shy of a Jonathan Demme.\u201d \u201cThose Jonathan Demme close-ups,\u201d he told Matt Zoller Seitz in The Wes Anderson Collection, \u201care the greatest.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf12004235215b082e3a8"}}
