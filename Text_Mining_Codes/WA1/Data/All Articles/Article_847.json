The emergency proclamation gives the Washington State Department of Natural Resources the ability to call on the resources of the National Guard and the State Guard on short notice to assist in responding to wildfires.\n\n\u201cThe fire danger now is unlike any we\u2019ve seen in a long time, if ever,\u201d Gov. Inslee said. \u201cWe need to be prepared for the possibility of an unprecedented fire season.\u201d\n\nThe declaration comes early this year in an effort to have firefighting resources ready to quickly mobilize and stamp out fire starts before they expand to larger wildfires. The order also empowers the Washington State Emergency Operations Center at Camp Murray to coordinate all incident-related assistance to the affected areas.\n\nLast week, about 125 new Washington National Guard members received firefighting training in Yakima. Last year, more than 850 Guard members helped fight wildfires.\n\nIn addition, Commissioner of Public Lands Peter Goldmark has banned all outdoor fires on Washington State Department of Natural Resources-protected lands. The Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission is likewise banning all campfires at state parks and on the ocean beaches Seashore Conservation Area.\n\nThis new burn ban, which supersedes DNR\u2019s June 22 statewide burn ban, prohibits campfires in state forests, state parks and anywhere else on the 13 million acres of Washington forestlands DNR protects from wildfire. It will be valid from today until September 30.\n\n\u201cThe weather forecasts are pointing to a dangerous weekend, with an ominous fire-weather pattern that shows hot temperatures, low humidity and high potential for lightning and gusty winds,\u201d said Goldmark.\n\n\u201cOur forests and grasslands are so dry that once a fire starts, it will be more difficult to suppress. We need to take all precautionary steps possible, and residents should do whatever they can to reduce the risk of human-caused wildfires,\u201d said Goldmark.\n\nThe expanded statewide ban prohibits all fires, including wood and charcoal fires in designated campground fire pits or campfire rings. Gas and propane cook stoves are allowed. Fireworks and incendiary devices, such as exploding targets, sky lanterns, or tracer ammunition, are always illegal on all DNR-protected forestlands, including state parks.\n\nThe DNR burn ban does not cover federal lands such as national forests, national parks, national wildlife refuges or other areas administered by federal agencies. It also does not cover county and municipal parks. Visitors to national, county and city parks should contact the park for specific restrictions on campfires.\n\nThe Governor and Commissioner are also urging people to limit their use of fireworks, or forgo fireworks completely.\n\n\u201cFireworks, while often part of our Fourth of July celebration, pose an increased risk with the extremely dry conditions we\u2019re experiencing this year,\u201d Gov. Inslee said. \u201cWe\u2019re strongly urging people to not use them this year and celebrate in a different way.\u201d\n\nResidents are encouraged to contact their local officials to determine whether any city or county ordinances are in place that prohibit the use of fireworks.\n\nDNR fire and forest health experts believe some of the uptick in the number of earlier fires is due to years of persistent drought on the east side of the Cascades, which have weakened forests and made them more susceptible to insects and disease. Ailing forests become flammable \u201ctinder bombs\u201d ready to ignite from a human-caused spark or lightning strike.\n\nOver recent years, the state wildfire season has begun earlier and with greater intensity. As of June 23, there have been 313 wildfires across the state. In 2014, by this date, there were 214 wildfires; in 2013 there were 169; in 2012 there were 155; and in 2011 there were 55 wildfires by this date.\n\nDNR is awaiting legislative action on requests for $4.5 million for additional firefighting teams and equipment and $20 million to improve the health of drought-ravaged, flammable forests.\n\nLast year\u2019s fire season was the biggest on record in Washington, with the largest state fire ever \u2014 the Carlton Complex \u2014 destroying more than 250,000 acres. More than 1 million acres of Washington\u2019s landscape has been consumed by wildfire since 2009.\n\nDNR\u2019s wildfire mission\n\nAdministered by Commissioner of Public Lands Peter Goldmark, DNR is responsible for preventing and fighting wildfires on 13 million acres of private, state and tribal-owned forestlands. DNR is the state\u2019s largest on-call fire department with more than 1,000 employees trained and available to be dispatched to fires as needed. During fire season, this includes more than 700 DNR employees who have other permanent jobs with the agency and about 400 seasonal employees hired for firefighting duties. Additionally, adult offenders from the Department of Corrections and juvenile offenders from the Department of Social and Health Services-Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration support firefighting efforts through DNR\u2019s Correctional Camps Program. DNR also participates in Washington's coordinated interagency approach to firefighting.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf34204235215b082e4a7"}}
