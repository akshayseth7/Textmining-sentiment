And then finishes you off with a gun.\u201d\n\nWithin days of Palmer\u2019s now infamous lion photo going viral, the Yelp page for River Bluff Dental, Palmer\u2019s practice, had been spammed in quantities that almost constitute a DDOS attack. The number quickly climbed to more than 8,000 \u201creviews\u201d (though it\u2019s now back to a couple of hundred, after a pruning from Yelp). The best were critical, the worst unprintable. Few had anything to do with dentistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen dozens of examples recently when businesses are being harassed, often very publicly. It\u2019s happening on a regular basis,\u201d Shannon Eis, Yelp\u2019s VP of corporate communications, told me. \u201cNot just the high-profile cases. We have an algorithm for detecting hate speech in user reviews. It\u2019s had thousands of flags.\u201d\n\nPalmer is only the latest flashpoint in a growing trend of shaming via Yelp. When the owner of Memories Pizza told local news in April that it would decline to cater a gay wedding, an international brigade weighed in on its Yelp page to attack what they saw as unacceptable bigotry. (Yelp had to remove 7,600 \u201creviews\u201d for TOS violation.) And it\u2019s not only liberals: Back in September 2012, the owner of Big Apple Pizza gave Obama a bear hug, only to find his page violated by right-wingers. (To date, 4,600 reviews have been removed.)\n\nYelp is working on it. \u201cWe are learning as we go,\u201d Eis admitted. \u201cNobody is prepared for that level of emotion and passion. And anger.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the co-opting of Yelp as a place for protest and shaming was inevitable. As our professional lives move online, Twitchfork mobs have reassembled to shame victims where it really hurts\u2014in their wallets. But this shift is accompanied by some uncomfortable tainting by association, and the bigger the outcry, the wider the target; Walter Palmer\u2019s daughter\u2019s dance studio\u2019s Yelp page remains partially vandalized at the time of writing. So does that of the PR firm that (very briefly) took on Palmer. \u201cHow could they represent such a depraved human being?\u201d asked Sidney S. of Irvine, California, among 43 other \u201creviews\u201d on the Yelp page of J. Austin & Associates. (The reviews have since been removed). The Yelp page listed a wrong number for the firm\u2014leading to a mystified home-owner fielding calls about animal rights ethics.\n\nIt seems ironic that Yelp\u2014founded by former Paypal employees about a decade ago, allowing customers to rate and review local businesses\u2014should have gone from being part of Web 2.0\u2019s dream of citizen democracy to a platform for attacking citizens. Throwing paint or smashing up a storefront is a hate-tactic with a history; it was inevitable it would eventually move online. But perhaps this is about more than shaming. Like the recent Ashley Madison leak, in which hackers threatened to unmask cheaters and adulterers, there\u2019s a strangely old-fashioned sense of moral standards here\u2014an expectation that people must be spotless in all aspects of their lives, that a blot on your personal record must impinge on your professional capability. The Yelp rating effectively becomes a citizen rating, and Palmer is a one-star human being. As work, play, and pleasure increasingly blend together\u2014a collapse of what NYU professor Helen Nissenbaum calls the \u201ccontextual integrity\u201d of our lives\u2014more of us may find ourselves attacked in this way.\n\nEven Yelp itself has not escaped public shaming. After it started editing out lion-related reviews of Palmer\u2019s dental practice, one person launched a Change.org petition bearing the slogan \u201cYelp: Post the Reviews!\u201d According to the petition, \u201cYelp censors their contributors to favor the interests of business.\u201d Nearly 1,000 people have signed up at the time of writing; Yelp declined to comment on the petition. \u201c\n\nCan\u2019t shame the man, shame the business. Can\u2019t shame the business, shame the business review site. There\u2019s a weirdly cat-and-mouse feel about shame culture, a sense of reputational eye-for-an-eye. When Boston chef-owner Michael Scelfo confronted a pair of customers who allegedly seated themselves without reservations, they threatened damning Yelp reviews. So Scelfo did what scores of service workers forced to turn the other cheek must long to do: he uploaded a shot of them to the Web with the hashtag #WeDoNotNegotiateWithYelpers. A shaming for a shaming: It\u2019s almost biblical.\n\nScelfo\u2019s bit of reverse-shaming isn\u2019t an isolated case. A New York City restaurant owner dealt some harsh words to customers who criticized the sandwiches at his Midtown deli saying he wanted to \u201cdefend myself and my business from a public complaints department.\u201d Elsewhere there are a growing number of cases where businesses on the raw end of consumer power have been taking negative reviewers to court on charges of libel. And when the attacks are scaled up and the Yelp page becomes a tool for social activism, well, a spamming can be met with a spamming: after the Big Apple Pizza\u2019s page was trashed by Obama-haters, scores of others waded in to leave five star ratings and glowing testimonials. Little of this concerned pizza.\n\nSlowly, we\u2019re beginning to see the birth of an entire \u201cshame economy\u201d\u2014one in which the threat of criticism becomes normalized, and new kinds of reputational management firms spring up to negotiate the emerging dynamics between businesses and customer-reviewer. \u201cIs It Worth Fighting Back Against Negative Reviewers?\u201d asks reviewtrackers.com, one service that helps firms defuse tensions after a mauling by Yelp or TripAdvisor.\n\nTalking to employees of Yelp\u2014a company accused by some businesses of racketeering or using shaming tactics itself against the makers of a Kickstarter documentary\u2014one gets the interesting sense they see themselves as partial victims of this kind of digital picketing, of the way they\u2019ve been made unwilling stewards of free speech. Whatever the rights or wrongs of Yelp itself, it\u2019s true that such attacks hit Yelp as hard as they hurt the victims. As reputational sites morph into shaming platforms, people start trusting them less; it can\u2019t be total coincidence Yelp posted disastrous results for the second quarter. (Possibly as a diversion, the company hosted a playful taco coupon giveaway for each time Donald Trump mentioned the word Mexico\u2014maybe a little public shaming isn\u2019t such a bad idea sometimes.)\n\nMaybe we\u2019ve been fooling ourselves into thinking sites like Yelp would result in an inspiring meritocracy in which citizen David beats down corporate Goliath with a well-aimed star rating. In fact Yelp\u2019s accessible, user-driven architecture is precisely the problem: because anyone can start a page for any business they like, they become a forum for public graffiti, abuse scrawled on a virtual wall\u2014whatever the original intention.\n\nThis is the Internet\u2019s fine print\u2014one that we\u2019re all going to have to start reading as cases like Palmer mount up. What frees the citizen to criticize also makes them targets for criticism\u2014or worse. As Yelp admitted grimly: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that this will be the last.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c304235215b082e469"}}
