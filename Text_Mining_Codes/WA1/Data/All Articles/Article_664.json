Today, Iovine runs Apple Music, the latest stop in a career that has taken him from studio rat to cofounder of Interscope Records to head of Beats Electronics. But he is also a longshoreman\u2019s son from Red Hook, Brooklyn, and he has inherited his native borough\u2019s brand of salty raconteurism. Over the years he\u2019s assembled a playlist of zingers to describe, for instance, his philosophy for dealing with prima donna artists (\u201cIf the shit gets bigger than the cat, out goes the cat\u201d) or his appeal to Dr. Dre to build headphones with him instead of designing an athletic shoe (\u201cFuck sneakers\u2014let\u2019s make speakers\u201d).\n\nBut the line I\u2019m talking about is the one he uses to describe his life\u2019s ambition: \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted to do is move the needle on popular culture.\u201d It sounds almost modest, the way he says it. Don\u2019t be fooled. Some music executives want to help talented artists reach their natural audience, no matter how small. Iovine is not among them. He\u2019s after the kind of massive flash points that unite populations around the world and change not just what they listen to but how they dress and move and behave and think and live. \u201cHe finds one great idea, gets rid of everything else, and chases it to the end of the earth until it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d says Luke Wood, president of Beats Electronics.\n\nBy his count, Iovine has pulled this off four times over the past couple of decades by (1) introducing the world to Snoop Dogg, Tupac, and Chronic-era Dr. Dre, (2) shepherding the careers of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, (3) giving Eminem his start, and (4) creating Beats, the hardware company that turned headphones into a fashion accessory and today accounts for 34 percent of US stereo headphone sales.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED Photo by: Joe Pugliese\n\nIovine accomplished this by deftly operating the machinery of mass culture. When radio stations refused to broadcast \u201cNuthin\u2019 but a \u2018G\u2019 Thang,\u201d the first single from The Chronic, Iovine bought 60-second ad spots and played snippets of the song during drive time so radio programmers would hear it during their commute. He got Snoop and Dre on the cover of Rolling Stone by convincing editor Jann Wenner that they were the second coming of Mick and Keith. He wheedled the video onto MTV\u2019s prime time, where gangsta rap had never previously appeared. The album probably would have been a hit anyway, but those three factors turned it into an international phenomenon. \u201cIt was huge,\u201d Dr. Dre says. \u201cIt brought so much more attention to what I was doing.\u201d\n\nWelp, the machinery of mass culture ain\u2019t what it used to be. MTV abandoned music videos when they became YouTube fodder, radio stations in the post-Clear Channel era would rather play the music of revenue-maximizing common denominators than edgy new pop acts, and magazines \u2026 uh, that\u2019s a touchy subject. That decline has occurred even as the Internet has placed the entire history of recorded music at our fingertips, leaving us with access to a universe of songs but without the tools to forge them into shared, generation-defining phenomena. We still have pop stars, but fewer and fewer of them have achieved the grandest pop ambition, as described by critic Greil Marcus: \u201cto remake America on his or her own terms.\u201d\n\nThen again, in a world where billions of people can communicate instantly around the globe and an app can reach millions of customers overnight, maybe we don\u2019t need music to change the world. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that standout technologists are referred to as \u201crock stars\u201d\u2014they\u2019re providing the sense of connection and awe that their musical forebears once did. Teenagers used to fantasize about becoming the next Jimmy Page; now they dream of becoming the next Larry Page. They wax nostalgic about the first time they used Snapchat, not the first time they heard \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you tell a kid, \u2018You\u2019ve got to pick music or Instagram,\u2019 they\u2019re not picking music,\u201d Iovine says. \u201cThere was a time when, for anybody between the ages of 15 and 25, music was one, two, and three. It\u2019s not anymore.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1a404235215b082e3ef"}}
