That sounds great, but unfortunately, they\u2019re talking about a lax timescale\u2014\u201cover the course of this century.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also committed to \u201cdoing our part to achieve a low-carbon global economy in the long-term,\u201d though they didn\u2019t announce any increased ambitions in cutting carbon in their own economies. Reports from the two-day meeting in Germany indicated that bolder statements were considered, including a call to decarbonize the G7 economies by 2050, but they were ultimately dropped, likely under pressure from Canada and Japan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThough today's statement is bold, the focus on the very long-term is disappointing. The G7 meeting was billed as a showcase for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, to assert leadership on climate change in advance of key negotiations in December, when world leaders will gather in Paris and are expected to sign the first-ever global agreement on climate change. Expectations for an ambitious outcome in Paris have been waning in recent months, and today\u2019s G7 statement doesn\u2019t help things much.\n\nEnvironmental organizations said that setting a goal of decarbonization by the end of the century is a signal to business that further investment in fossil fuel infrastructure could lead to \u201cstranded assets.\u201d May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re still holding onto fossil fuel stocks, you\u2019re betting on the past. As today\u2019s announcement makes clear, the future belongs to renewables.\u201d However, nothing terribly new has actually happened: Many climate projections were already using the relatively low-ambition G7 target.\n\nAccording to the independent Climate Action Tracker, the world\u2019s current policies will result in global warming of 3.6 to 4.2 degrees Celsius by 2100. That\u2019s just half a degree less than it predicts we would see if nothing changed, and the consequences of half-action are truly frightening. Even the current pledges of the G7 countries, if converted into effective policies, likely wouldn\u2019t be enough for the world to stay under the previously agreed-upon goal of keeping warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe G7\u2014which is comprised of Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, and Japan, plus the European Union\u2014were responsible for 59 percent of historical global carbon dioxide emissions as of 2011, according to the World Resources Institute. That percentage is falling as developing countries, mainly China, rapidly expand their economies. Still, this outsized share means the world\u2019s richest countries have a responsibility to help the world transition to a zero carbon economy as quickly as possible.\n\nA new report from Oxfam shows that five of the seven countries\u2014including Germany\u2014have increased their use of coal over the last five years. Those that didn\u2019t\u2014the U.S. and Canada\u2014are in the midst of an oil and gas renaissance and largely offset their decreased coal use with other fossil fuels. Germany\u2019s bold Energiewende plan to transform its energy sector away from nuclear energy has at least partially resulted in temporarily increased emissions from its coal sector to fill the gap as more solar and wind power comes online.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf11304235215b082e39f"}}
