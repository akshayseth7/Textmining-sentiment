As George seeks to pick up the broken pieces of his life, he seeks encouragement from his closest friends, bonds with a young boy whom he feels a special connection with, and, finally, learns to find grace in a world that, so often, is as cruel as a batch of bad envelope glue.\n\nThis will make you love Seinfeld again and, as importantly, realize just how crazy it was that the most popular sitcom in the country spent a year mining comedy from a dead fianc\u00e9e. Macabre was mainstream.\n\nThe best line in the trailer might be Jerry's, when he wisely advises George, \"Her death takes place in the shadow of new life; she's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.\" You suddenly wonder whether Jerry was a profound philosopher \u2014 until you remember it's a quote from Wrath of Khan.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeec604235215b082e1f3"}}
