The New Hampshire Education Summit, sponsored by the school choice advocacy organization the American Federation for Children and hosted by Brown\u2019s glossy new school-reform website, the Seventy Four (both, it is safe to say, are sympathetic to right-leaning education proposals currently in vogue), gave the six GOP candidates who showed up 45-plus minutes each to expound their views on K\u201312 education. The result was a daylong school-choice lovefest. Here\u2019s what the candidates covered (hint: race, class, and poverty seldom made the cut).\n\nJeb Bush\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe opening act was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was far more comfortable and commanding than at the Republican candidates debate two weeks ago*. Bush, the (dubiously) self-proclaimed \u201ceducation governor,\u201d has well-known views on education, and he didn\u2019t deviate from the formula much. He supports vouchers, which he claims didn\u2019t \u201cdestroy public education\u2014that\u2019s a myth that was shattered by Florida,\u201d and the general marketplace-driven competition of the charter movement: \u201cThe public schools have to get better or they close. This is America.\u201d\n\nWhen Brown veered to Common Core, Bush joked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d before coming out in veiled support of some form of state-derived standards (which are the same thing as the Common Core standards, since governors derived them). \u201cWe can\u2019t keep dumbing down standards,\u201d he said, then reminisced about his Spanish AP teacher at Andover who, in forcing him to read Cervantes and Borges his sophomore year, taught him that \u201chigh expectations matter.\u201d\n\nBush also loves the \u201cnerdy concept\u201d of Title I portability that lets free- and reduced-meals students take their Title I dollars to the school of their choice. When asked about his pick for secretary of education, Bush gestured at his interviewer\u2014a good indication of the tenor of hard-hitting conversation that Brown would be leading throughout the day. Bush also doubled down on his support for keeping the federal testing schedule in place and endorsed more federal money going to pay for privately run pre-K programs.\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, kicked it off with some nice bromides about every child having \u201cvast potential.\u201d Without mentioning race or poverty, she pointed out that \u201cdisparity gaps\u201d in education are getting worse despite our ever-rising financial investments in it, which to her proves that there is no correlation between money and educational outcomes; one of her first big applause lines was \u201cwe know factually speaking that when Washington spends more money, the quality of education in this country does not improve.\u201d The Department of Education is obviously to blame: \u201cWhen was the last time anyone did an audit of the Department of Education?\u201d she asked at one point. (Answer: The department is audited every year.)\n\nSo bureaucracy is bad, and\u2014drumroll, please\u2014so is the Common Core. \u201cCommon Core,\u201d Fiorina said, \u201cmay have started out as a set of standards but what it\u2019s turned into is a program that, honestly, is being overly influenced by companies that have something to gain\u2014testing companies and textbook companies.\u201d\n\nBetween fond reminiscences of her childhood teachers, one of whom used to throw erasers lovingly at the back wall of the classroom, Fiorina took several opportunities to slam teachers\u2019 unions: \u201cWe need to reward excellence. Unions reward seniority. That discourages excellence.\u201d No big shocker there. And Fiorina is so in favor of putting accountability in the hands of parents that she offered support for the opt-out testing movement. (Last week, she aired similar views on opting out of vaccinations.)\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nEvery time Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2014tieless and strenuously California business casual on Wednesday\u2014takes the stage, I think, \u201cWow, if the Republicans weren\u2019t too insane right now to notice, this guy could really be president.\u201d Kasich doesn\u2019t let anyone forget that he\u2019s in charge of a crucial swing state, where, he claims, he\u2019s gotten \u201c85 to 90 percent of everything we wanted\u201d in education, like vouchers galore and improvements in troubled systems in Cleveland and Youngstown.\n\nHe likes charters (who at this forum doesn\u2019t?) but was quick to say that the failing ones should be closed, and remained staunch on his support for Common Core standards. Show him a good reason to ditch them and he\u2019ll consider it, but, Kasich said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my position because there are four people in the front row yelling at me.\u201d\n\nOne weird note in an otherwise respectful conversation occurred when Kasich said, \u201cIf I were not president, but if I were King of America, I would abolish all teacher's lounges, where they sit together and worry about \u2018woe is us.\u2019 \u201d After that out-of-nowhere stab (earlier in his speech, Kasich had acknowledged successfully collaborating with teachers\u2019 unions in rebuilding Cleveland\u2019s schools), Kasich ended by echoing a nod to God he\u2019d made earlier in the forum: \u201cI believe the Lord watches what we do with our children. And the more we dedicate ourselves to having those children rise, and to use their great brains to help heal this world and bring justice, the happier He is.\u201d Er ... OK?\n\nScott Walker\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker surely accepted Brown\u2019s invitation with alacrity, for it gave him a chance to refashion his famous union-busting passions as a noble fight for education reform. After all, that\u2019s what ending collective bargaining in Wisconsin was all about, right? Walker loves teachers; that\u2019s why he dissolved their unions, to protect the best of them from damaging union policies like \u201clast hired, first fired.\u201d And the teachers are grateful to him! \u201cI can tell when a teacher is supportive of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Walker said, \u201cbecause they lean into me, look both ways and whisper, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLike most of the candidates, Walker borrows the language of the marketplace to talk about the benefit of school choice: Vouchers and charters (which succeed because they can get around the \u201cnuances of contracts\u201d) force all schools to \u201cup their game,\u201d because that\u2019s how capitalism works. At one point, Walker even held up a dollar bill and asked, \u201cWhere would you rather spend this? In Washington or your local school?\u201d Like teachers unions, the federal government is just another \u201cbarrier\u201d to a good education, which is why Walker doesn\u2019t think it should have a role in accountability: \u201cI don\u2019t think the president is responsible for holding governors accountable,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI believe the people are responsible.\u201d\n\nWhat struck me most about the often stiff, stony Walker was his self-assurance and liveliness when talking about these issues\u2014but then they're at the core of his worldview, after all. He displayed actual animation on numerous subjects, including the role of technology in kids\u2019 lives. \u201cMy son Matthew can tie a bow tie much better than I can because he learned it on YouTube,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was another unexpectedly energetic speaker on the subject of K\u201312 education in his state. He began by talking about next week\u2019s 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and how it revolutionized the education system of New Orleans. \"It is hard to overstate how bad our public school system was,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cAnd it was expensive.\u201d But now New Orleans, the only \u201c100% choice\u201d city in the country, is the shining beacon of why education reform works: Pre-Katrina, Jindal said, 60 percent of kids were in failing schools; now it\u2019s only 10 percent.\n\nThough he was a bit shakier when it came to policy details for the rest of Louisiana, Jindal didn\u2019t back down from his repudiation of Common Core: \u201cI like the concept of what I thought Common Core was going to be\u201d was the most he\u2019d allow of his past support. He then told his favorite story about how his son\u2019s experience applying, or failing to apply, a labyrinthine method to simple arithmetic. Here, for once, Brown pushed back, saying that her son\u2019s Common Core-aligned Singapore math homework \u201cfascinated\u201d her.\n\nBut nope, Jindal wasn\u2019t buying it. Unlike the \u201celites\u201d who want to mandate how many Big Gulps New Yorkers consume in a day, he pretty wants much the federal government out of the classroom. Writing massive checks to states is fine, but otherwise, the feds should get out and stay out.\n\nChris Christie\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has no intention of backing down from his controversial wish, proclaimed earlier this month, to punch teachers unions in the face. Au contraire: Christie began his confab with Brown by digging in on the statement, saying that unions \u201care punching us all the time. They deserve it back.\u201d\n\nBut then, in a departure, the pugnacious governor described how he\u2014unlike President George W. Bush\u2014worked with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, on spending (or squandering, depending on your perspective) Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $100 million donation to the Newark schools. \u201cI didn\u2019t like [working with Weingarten], but I did it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nChristie also stood his ground on his about-face on Common Core, which he repudiated, he said, not for political reasons but because \u201cthree constituencies\u201d\u2014teachers, parents, and students\u2014hated it. \u201cWhen something doesn\u2019t work that we try, we then have to change it.\u201d\n\nBut even more so than when he was condemning teachers unions, Christie became most jazzed when describing his technological pipe dreams for education. Instead of weighing themselves down with all those hefty textbooks, every child in America should get an iPad! And banish blackboards\u2014Smart Boards only FTW! Exactly how many Mark Zuckerbergs would it take to bankroll that one?", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1d604235215b082e41b"}}
