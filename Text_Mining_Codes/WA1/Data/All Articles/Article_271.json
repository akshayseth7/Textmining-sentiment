Social Networking Services\n\nSlate has worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, and others to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.\n\nYou also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.\n\n7. Privacy Policy Updates\n\nWe may modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Services or other appropriate notice.

Links to Third Party Sites and Services\n\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by Slate.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.\n\n9. International Users\n\nPlease note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States. While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, Slate commits to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.\n\n10. Your California Privacy Rights\n\nIt is our policy not to share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\n\nSome web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Slate currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.\n\n11. Communications Preferences\n\nYou may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link included in the commercial e-mails you receive. Please note that opt-out requests may take up to 10 business days to be effective. Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.\n\n12.
