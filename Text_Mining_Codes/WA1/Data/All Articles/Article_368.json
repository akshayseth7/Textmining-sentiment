The day before the ceremony, the university sent an email to Columbia's seniors, warning them of a new rule that barred students from bringing \"large objects which could interfere with the proceedings or create discomfort to others in close, crowded spaces shared by thousands of people.\"\n\nSulkowicz brought the mattress on stage with her anyway, prompting cheers from the crowd. Her alleged rapist, a fellow graduating senior who was never charged and is suing the university for allowing the art project to go on, was listed on the Class Day program. Many students and activists praised Sulkowicz for seeing her project through to the end. Other students criticized the university for not forcing Sulkowicz to follow the rules it set.\n\n\u201cWe communicated to all students that the shared celebratory purpose of Class Day and commencement calls for mutual respect for the security and comfort of graduating students and their families in attendance,\u201d Columbia said in a statement. \u201cWe are not going to comment on individual students; it is a day for all members of the Class of 2015. We were not going to physically block entry to graduates who are ultimately responsible for their own choices.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf03204235215b082e2c7"}}
