They\u2019re now having a great fall. Mulan on Once Upon a Time recently revealed that she was in love with Sleeping Beauty. ABC\u2019s Betrayal features a lesbian techie who is having sleepovers with the leading man\u2019s daughter. The last ex of the attractive assistant on CBS\u2019s The Crazy Ones was a woman. On NBC\u2019s forthcoming Dracula, a boy-crazy Victorian flirt may actually be in love with her female best friend, and on Super Fun Night, a character who was initially coded as gay may or may not be in love with hers. The Bridge\u2019s best and most competent character was a Latina lesbian reporter. Charlie Harper\u2019s long-lost daughter on Two and a Half Men is gay\u2014on last week\u2019s show, she and Walden (Ashton Kutcher) even slept with the same woman at an orgy. Meanwhile, The Good Wife\u2019s Kalinda remains as ambisexual as ever, Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Callie and Arizona are on the verge of breaking up, and Pretty Little Liars\u2019 Emily just sent her long-term girlfriend off to Stanford.\n\nWilla Paskin Willa Paskin is Slate\u2019s television critic.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the surge of lesbian characters on television. First and foremost, it\u2019s not boring. TV plots, especially romantic ones, repeat themselves over and over again. It\u2019s not just that if you\u2019ve seen one triangle you\u2019ve seen them all, it\u2019s that we have all seen literally hundreds of love triangles. There is very little that straight people can get up to, especially in the PG strictures of network television, that is new. (Masters of Sex has self-pleasuring with a giant glass dildo named Cyclops covered.) Even when lesbians are involved in otherwise rote story lines\u2014the woman terrified of commitment learns to commit! The woman stuck in the friend zone doesn\u2019t want to be!\u2014it\u2019s at least a new take on an otherwise tired plot point. (Just imagine how much better 2 Broke Girls would be if the long-term story was a slow-growing love affair between its two title characters, which I still think it should be.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe preponderance of lesbians on TV is also progressive\u2014representation is a good thing\u2014but not nearly as progressive as it first appears. While the characters on Orange, The Fosters, and The Killing are fully developed, on shows likes The Crazy Ones, Dracula, Rookie Blue, and Mistresses, girl-on-girl dabbling is often presented as just another quirk of a sexually adventurous young woman, proof that she is fit to star in a straight dude\u2019s fantasy, even if it\u2019s also simultaneous proof of her emotional depth. (On Mistresses, Josslyn\u2019s relationship with a woman was the most serious she\u2019d ever had, while also being a kinky phase she could tease future boy-toys with.)\n\nLesbian story lines are to network television what nudity is to premium cable: a turn-on masquerading as proof of seriousness.\n\nShows like Mistresses, Rookie Blue, Betrayal, and Once Upon a Time put lesbians or bisexual women in supporting roles to signify their adult aesthetic. Lesbian story lines are to network television what nudity is to premium cable: a turn-on masquerading as proof of seriousness. There is at least an upside to this: Lesbians have become shorthand for sophisticated, steamy, romantic, intriguing. In the interest of titillation, television has banished the stereotype of the sexless lesbian.\n\nBut you only have to compare the prevalence of lesbians making out on television to the dearth of gay men doing the same to see that the medium is far from a bastion of open-mindedness. On television, women longing for other women may be hot, but men longing for other men is still decidedly not. TV\u2019s gay men hardly ever get any action, and you will rarely see a bisexual guy falling for another man, and certainly never in a story line that could be described as swoony.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21d04235215b082e433"}}
