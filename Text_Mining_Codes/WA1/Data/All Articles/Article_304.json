A few years earlier, Guido had tried to live with his mother but returned to Paraguay soon thereafter since the demands of Conde\u2019s job made it too difficult for her to take care of her own child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShortly after working on the story, Proujansky received a text from Conde saying Guido would be permanently moving to New York to live with her; it felt like a happy ending to Proujansky\u2019s story.\n\nBut Guido\u2019s arrival took the story in a new direction, specifically, how would Conde, as a single mother, be able to help Guido navigate the complicated systems of middle-class America, one Proujansky said Guido was \u201csort of dropped into.\u201d\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nBack in Paraguay, Conde\u2019s mother took care of Guido, a common scenario for many immigrant families separated by long distances. Guido was doing well there, exceling at soccer, taking swimming lessons, and attending a private school that Conde\u2019s salary was able to cover. But in New York, he was now living a much more complicated life, starting school in the middle of the year with limited language skills while sharing a tiny apartment with his mother who worked long hours.\n\nWhile they were living apart, Conde was still an invested parent, texting and calling often. \u201cHe would ask if he could have an ice cream and was told he could if he did his homework,\u201d Proujansky recalled. But rewarding good behavior from a distance is one thing, trying to get your child into the best high school in New York is something completely different.\n\n\u201cHe was going from being a middle-class kid to being a poor immigrant kid in Queens whose mom was working long hours,\u201d Proujansky said. \u201cHer abilities were all about working harder, so when he would struggle she would tell him to do more homework, work harder, and that\u2019s a good skill if you\u2019re trying to make money to send home. But to become a middle class American he needed skills Blanca didn\u2019t have, like which person to talk with to get into an after-school program and how to choose from New York City\u2019s 400 public high schools.\u201d\n\nProujansky documented those adjustments from March through December when she would visit Blanca and Guido both at home and in their school and work environments. Although there were struggles, she said the change in Blanca once Guido arrived was remarkable.\n\n\u201cFor families who rely on remittances, the definition of family isn\u2019t about nuclear units. As the person who could earn the highest wage, Blanca looked at what was best for her family and decided to go where she was best able to support them, although it meant missing Guido\u2019s childhood. It was clear how painful this was for Blanca, seeing how depressed she was before he came to New York and how much better she felt when he was here\u2014it was a huge sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nWhile Proujansky was working on the series, she had difficulty finding reliable and affordable day care for her 2-year-old son. The demands of a culture that requires longer working hours and greater accessibility trickle down to child care workers, who must also juggle responsibilities, often working under meager wages.\n\n\u201cPeople often talk about how expensive child care is, and I can agree from personal experience that it is, but at the same time it\u2019s too cheap because it doesn\u2019t allow many child care workers to make a living wage,\u201d Proujansky said.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle Proujansky says is rooted in mixed messages about how we raise our children in America.\n\n\u201cI think our culture both devalues caretaking and puts a really rosy filter on it. As a mother you\u2019re supposed to love sacrificing and caring for your kid all the time, but professionals who do that work aren\u2019t well compensated financially. Women are encouraged to want to work and have it all but also to feel badly for leaving our kids in child care, and our cultural hesitation to fully support child care workers is related to these misgivings we have about working motherhood in general. We are uncomfortable valuing care work because we think it should be given selflessly.\u201d\n\nAlissa Quart\u2019s reporting and Alice Proujansky\u2019s photography for this story were supported with funding from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAlice Proujansky\n\nAlice Proujansky", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeff504235215b082e287"}}
