Their numbers will only rise as more arrive from Greece, where a record 50,000 reached land by boat from Turkey in July alone.\n\nA Reuters cameraman saw police fire tear gas to disperse a crowd seeking passage into Macedonia, the latest flashpoint of a crisis that has dragged the conflicts of the Middle East to Europe's doorstep.\n\nWitnesses said several stun grenades were also used and at least four people bore leg wounds. The government sent the army to the border as reinforcement.\n\nThe flare-up was brief, but the plight facing those in no-man\u2019s land threatens to worsen as more arrive. Reuters reporters said aid agencies did not appear to have access to the no-man's land, though the Red Cross, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) were present either side of the border.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the fate of those stuck in no-man's land, calling for restraint and urgent humanitarian aid.\n\nThe UNHCR criticized the border closure. \"These are refugees in search of protection and must not be stopped from doing so,\" said chief spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.\n\nFleming called on Europe - deeply divided over how to respond - to find a solution, saying overstretched Macedonia and Serbia \"cannot be left alone with this number of refugees.\"\n\nA UNHCR official on the ground said Greece estimated between 3,000 and 4,000 men, women and children were in the border area. \"They expect this number to go higher,\" said Petros Mastakas.\n\nHUNGARIAN FENCE\n\nSome managed to cross during the night, telling Reuters others were caught by police and driven back into no-man\u2019s land.\n\n\u201cI ran fast and escaped,\u201d said Mohammed Khalid, an 18-year-old Syrian from the devastated city of Aleppo. \u201cThey got my brother and most of the others and sent them back to Greece.\u201d\n\nThe Interior Ministry, in a statement, said its measures were working and that it had admitted 181 foreign nationals overnight - \"a limited number of migrants of vulnerable categories who could be adequately treated in line with the country's capacities.\"\n\nMacedonia says it has registered over 40,000 migrants and refugees entering from Greece in the past two months; most move quickly through the country to Serbia and then walk into Hungary and on to the more affluent countries of western and northern Europe through the borderless Schengen area.\n\nHungary is racing to complete construction of a fence along its 175 km border with Serbia to keep them out, a step that threatens to create a bottleneck of tens of thousands in Serbia.\n\nThe refugee wave has diverted some attention from a political crisis rocking the conservative government of Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski for most of the year over allegations of illegal wire-taps, corruption and authoritarianism.\n\nHe now faces an early election in April next year. Some commentators suggested it may play well with voters for the government to be seen taking on Greece for allowing thousands of migrants to pour across its northern border.\n\nMacedonia and Greece have long enjoyed an uneasy relationship, rooted in a dispute over Macedonia\u2019s name since it broke away from socialist Yugoslavia in 1991. The row has effectively blocked Macedonia\u2019s integration with NATO and the European Union.\n\nMacedonia has confronted refugee crises before, most notably in 1999 during the war in Serbia\u2019s then southern province of Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians took shelter in refugee camps on Macedonia\u2019s northern border.\n\n(Additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in GENEVA, Matt Robinson and Aleksandar Vasovic in BELGRADE; Writing by Matt Robinson; editing by Philippa Fletcher)", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee5004235215b082e19a"}}
