The question of romantic longevity is a banal one for a young dinner guest to ask of her older hosts to be sure, but it\u2019s the right one on Vicious, the British sitcom starring Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi that\u2019s just been imported to PBS. Freddie and Stuart, who have been together 48 years, survey each other across the coffee table in a late-season episode, a certain morbid curiosity tinting their shared gaze. \u201cWell, I mostly attribute it to the fact that he won\u2019t leave,\u201d Freddie offers, matter-of-factly. Stuart\u2019s eyes narrow and his mouth tightens grimly: \u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019m going to so enjoy unplugging you.\u201d\n\nJ. Bryan Lowder J. Bryan Lowder is a Slate associate editor. He writes and edits for Outward, Slate\u2019s LGBTQ section, and for the culture section.\n\nThese dark quips are played for laughs, of course, but the exchange\u2014and indeed, the entirety of the series\u2014also functions as a profound answer to the question. How do two people, in particular two gay men, build and maintain a loving relationship for half a century?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nVicious\u2019 advice: by endeavoring daily to tear the whole thing apart.\n\nExecutive producer and writer Gary Janetti (of Will & Grace fame), has delivered something of an essay in this show, a thinking-through of a particular gay male approach to long-term love, domesticity, and aging that also happens to satisfy, most of the time, as comedy in an almost Wildean mold. Vicious may take its old-fashioned setup/punchline/laughter formula from dusty British antecedents like Are You Being Served? (1972-1985), but the themes it\u2019s wrestling with are incredibly vital in 2014, a year in which the judicially aided rollout of gay marriage across the United States will afford many couples the chance to legally commit to the kind of union at which Freddie and Stuart are old hands. Indeed, Janetti seems to think that lovestruck youngsters might have something to learn from these pre-Stonewall relics, and it\u2019s not just how to pack wallops into witticisms.\n\nOf course, that Vicious dares to explore a model of gay male intimacy that goes against the grain of current Looking-like trends in gay representation is to invite the most frustrating and predictable sorts of criticism. While most American reviewers have cautiously limited their approval to McKellan and Jacobi\u2019s acting chops, a number both here and in Great Britain have looked at the way Vicious treats the relationship of Freddie and Stuart\u2014both unapologetic embodiments of the venerable swishy, \u201cbitter old queen\u201d archetype\u2014as worthy dramatic material and recoiled with the usual queen-phobic horror. To pick one example, Matthew Gilbert\u2019s Boston Globe headline suggested that Vicious was little more than \u201ca vicious circle of gay stereotypes.\u201d One imagines that Gilbert and those who share his view would prefer to have us watching a show in which, I don\u2019t know, a man, his sleeves rolled up just so, quietly fills out a joint tax return while his husband competently tosses a football in the backyard with their well-adjusted son.\n\nAnd Quentin Crisp wept.\n\nNo, Freddie and Stuart do not speak or emote or worry or love each other in the Dignified, Masculine ways that gay men are supposed to these days\u2014but does that mean that Vicious\u2019 portrait of a camp-infused gay partnership has nothing to say about making it long-term in the real world?\n\nIn his book How to Be Gay, sexuality studies scholar David Halperin considers whether there might be a unique gay perspective on love, and he concludes that there is\u2014and it starts with recognizing the \u201cinauthenticity at the core of romantic love, to understand romantic love as a social institution, an ideology, a role, a performance, and a social genre, while still \u2026 succumbing to it.\u201d Being natural-born outsiders to straight social institutions like coupledom and marriage, gays face a choice: reject them entirely; assimilate with the single-minded fervor of a newly arrived immigrant; or, as Halperin advises, enter into them with a kind of queer double-consciousness that allows self-awareness and abandon, mockery and seriousness, simultaneously.\n\nGay male culture has in fact elaborated a distinctive, dissident perspective on romantic love, a camp perspective, which straight people often regard as cynical, precisely because its irony\u2014which emphasizes the performativity of romantic roles\u2014seems to them to undermine the seriousness and sincerity of love, and thereby to demean it \u2026 [But] Gay male culture\u2019s vision of love is not a cynical one. Rather \u2026 [it encourages] an outlook on love that is disabused, but not disenchanted.\u201d\n\nWatching Vicious, one gets the sense that though Freddie and Stuart have long been disabused of the \u201csweetness and light\u201d approach to love that straight society holds so dear, they remain steadfastly enchanted with one another. But with the appearance of campy insults in their home second only in frequency to cups of tea, how can this be? Shouldn\u2019t one or the other of them have gotten fed up by now?\n\nThe answer depends on how you understand their particular Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? camp performance to be functioning. If the jabs are just that, then sure, the shtick might grow tiresome. But what if the jabs\u2014about decaying bodies and failing minds, about foolish attractions and absurd pretensions\u2014are actually expressions of affection, promises of commitment? What if barb-trading is the most meaningful way for two people who recognize full-well the ridiculousness of long-term love to communicate, nevertheless, their intention to continue on the fool\u2019s errand for yet another day?\n\nA Slate Plus Special Feature: Did You Finish Binge-Watching Orange Is the New Black?

Love, no matter how glowing and true, has little hope of surviving if factory quality is its only support. But these old queens\u2014and indeed, any couple who looks to traditional gay male culture for advice\u2014have a failsafe at their disposal. Camp allows them to exercise their inevitable disappointment with the human condition\u2014whether over physical aging, personal shortcomings, or roads not taken\u2014in the open air, in a stylized game that is both refreshingly frivolous and deeply serious, such that it does not curdle into something truly threatening.\n\nIndeed, thanks to camp, Freddie and Stuart can be not only lovers to one another, but also the girlfriend to whom you bitch about your lover over a glass of wine\u2014a possibly healthier and, in any case, more efficient arrangement than the norm. This is what Halperin means when he writes that the presence of a camp sensibility in a male couple\u2019s romantic life \u201cindicates the fusion of gay desire and gay sisterhood.\u201d It\u2019s an enviable situation that\u2019s as uncommon as it is underappreciated; that Janetti has been able to do it justice in a 22-minute sitcom is an impressive feat indeed.\n\nBut more impressive even than these sociological achievements is the wholly unexpected intimacy that Vicious encourages between its primary couple and its viewers. Much as when Ash, the young, perpetually tight-shirted upstairs neighbor wanders into a wake the pair is hosting, I was struck while watching the show by a distinct sense of voyeurism, of stumbling into the private life of a couple whose love for one another is deep, even if their way of expressing it is unconventional. Yes, Freddie and Stuart bicker, but they also approach the world as a duet. They move\u2014literally crossing their legs\u2014in rhythm, they are miffed by the same breaches of etiquette, each senses when the other is being bothered by an outsider and quickly steps in to dismiss the offending party. (\u201cGo on, we\u2019re done with you for now,\u201d Freddie informs Ash.) Small, almost unconscious acts of tenderness crop up in the midst of even brutal verbal sparring matches: a teacup is refilled, a scarf and coat are removed, a late-night glass of port is shared. If you, like Matthew Gilbert, think Freddie and Stuart\u2019s \u201cpartnership is based on mutual contempt,\u201d you are a poor observer of human beings.\n\nTo be fair, missing all this would be easy if you approach Vicious with a \u201cgood gay\u201d agenda rather than an open mind; I myself had certainly not expected a throwback sitcom about two aging homos and their friends to grapple with these issues with such sophistication, while managing to be generally funny and always warm. However, the fact that detractors would rather scream \u201cstereotype!\u201d than deal with the challenges to orthodoxy that Vicious lays out, smacks, at best, of a dreadful lack of imagination\u2014and, at worst, of a blind contempt for any representation of gay people and their relationships that does not match the bland, heteronormative ideal currently in vogue.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c204235215b082e467"}}
