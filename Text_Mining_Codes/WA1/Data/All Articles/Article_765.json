There were very few websites, period. The Internet was an infant, crawling ever so slowly (remember dial up?) into our lives.\n\nJump forward two decades, and my, how things have changed. Epicurious is thriving, and so much faster, too. The site (which, like WIRED, is owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast) turns 20 this week, which in Internet years makes it old enough to get an AARP membership card in the mail.\n\nBut as they say, with age comes wisdom, or at least some hard-earned lessons. Epicurious just published a massive oral history of its origin story, and it offers some fantastic When I was your age moments that remind us of what life was like on the Internet in the mid-90s. Which is to say barely working, and a little lawless. As Kevin Slavin, a first-hire designer at the online magazine and now a professor at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, remembers it, \u201cIt was clear, not in a bad way, that nobody knew what they were doing, including me. We were going to make this up.\u201d\n\nThat uncertainty was in many ways a blessing. Without a definitive guidebook dictating how to design for the web, Slavin and his colleagues (including art director Mark Michaelson) were more or less free to create a website from scratch, exactly the way they wanted to. It\u2019s a freedom echoed in other accounts of the early web: With no rules to abide by, you made them up as you went along.\n\nWith that in mind, I sifted through Epicurious\u2019 oral history to reveal some of the most enlightening bits.\n\nLearn From the Past\n\nToday, most websites follow basic navigational rules, but in the early days of the web, typical website architecture was non-existent. Epicurious designed its website like a tabloid. It looked like a newspaper with clickable links. Slavin says this wasn\u2019t a nod to a familiar format but an effective way of presenting and organizing a ton of information. Hyperlinks still were a challenging concept\u2014you can just click on that? And why were they blue? This was years before best-practices crystalized into user-interface givens.\n\nAt that point, I thought, \u201cYou have a homepage. What else is there?\u201d To get the architecture through my head, Kevin would spread big pieces of white paper on the ground and crawl around drawing and saying, \u201cThis goes to here, and then you have to go back to here. From every page, you need to be able to do this and this.\u201d \u2014Mark Michaelson, former art director Mark wasn\u2019t designing by looking at the web. He was basically designing a tabloid, beautifully, better than anyone else could have designed a website. My role was figuring out how to translate that vision. \u2014Kevin Slavin, former designer It was so limited. The Internet was mostly ASCII text. An Internet designer was really like an icon designer, designing little envelopes and little symbols. I was very frustrated, because I wanted to do glorious designs. It seemed like everything we wanted to do was pushing it a little too far, and we had to pull it back. \u2014Mark Michaelson\n\nMonks: The Proto-Blogging Platform\n\nAnd then there was the whole content thing. You couldn\u2019t just upload your words to WordPress and click publish. In the early days, getting content online was a manual process. Perhaps the most mind-boggling nugget from the oral history is that a group of cybermonks (WIRED wrote about them in 1996) was responsible for digitizing much of the early web\u2019s content.\n\nHow are we going to digitize all these recipes and get them online and get them searchable? I worked with the monks to digitize the recipes and set up the recipe database. \u2014Gail Horwood Oh yeah! The Electronic Scriptorium. That was fantastic. How you got recipes on the Internet? Monks down in Virginia. They\u2019re educated. They got free time. They can type well. That\u2019s what they do. They just cranked through all those recipes. That was fantastic. \u2014Wendell Lansford They digitized for a number of publishers and had strict standards. For example they would not accept digitization work from Playboy. The recipes couldn\u2019t be scanned because in those days scanners couldn\u2019t translate all the special characters and fractions found in recipes. \u2014Gail Horwood\n\nThese monks were very, very thorough.\n\nWe would compile hundreds of recipes and send them off to them. We cut the recipes out of the magazine. I would photocopy that page. I would look at the photocopied page and make sure it was readable. Then I would cut the recipe out and I would tape it into the middle of a blank page, and photocopy it again. We\u2019d had to make sure nothing else was on the page, otherwise they\u2019d type it up, too. Like the ding bat at the end of the recipe? They\u2019d type those up. \u2014Melinda Anderson, former intern\n\nAnd apparently quite good at cooking!\n\nWe were feverishly building this database with a couple of thousand recipes at launch \u2014 racing to ensure that there would be enough choices for people who searched it. And my liaison for the monks was like, \u201cOh, I think I forgot to mention they\u2019re going on hiatus.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She was like, \u201cWell they have to bake fruitcakes. That\u2019s how they make all their money.\u201d Because it was Thanksgiving, and that\u2019s what they do. They bake fruitcakes for another six weeks. So literally there was no digitizing going on, because they were off on their other job, which was baking fruitcakes. \u2014Gail Horwood\n\nA lot has changed in the last two decades, for Epicurious and for the Internet. The web is a different place today. It\u2019s faster and more reliable, but also a little bit \u2026 boring. The improvisation of the early web has turned into efficiency, and we should be grateful. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for content-digitizing monks. Still, it\u2019s hard to not feel a pang of nostalgia for a time when people felt like they were creating something totally new. As Slavin puts it: \u201cThe internet has become something you use, rather than something you work with. But there was a moment when everyone had access to one another, and that was cool.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2a604235215b082e454"}}
