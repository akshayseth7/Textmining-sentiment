Duggar served as the Executive Director of the FRC\u2019s lobbying arm, meaning that his everyday job was to advance these positions in the public space and to government officials. As his now-deleted biography from their website stated:\n\nDrawing from his unique experiences in family, entertainment, politics and business, Josh seeks to use his God-given platform to encourage others to be engaged in the political process.\n\nWith that, it may be pointless to try and find more examples.\n\n[Image via Josh Duggar/Twitter]\n\n\u2014\n\n>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeec804235215b082e1f4"}}
