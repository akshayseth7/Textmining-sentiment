One thing we\u2019ve learned is that tribal loyalty often prevents police officers from criticizing each other or their departments publicly\u2014and at least sometimes, they lie when one of their own faces charges of misconduct. That\u2019s why the recent emergence of Michael Wood Jr., a retired Baltimore cop, as a critic of law enforcement culture landed with impact: His voice was the relatively rare one that spoke with the knowledge of an insider but the unforgiving skepticism of an outsider.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll meet Wood while he drives the streets of the city where he served as a police officer for 11 years, and hear him lay out his conception of what\u2019s going wrong in the world of policing and how it could be made right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOnly have a minute? Here are the parts you shouldn\u2019t miss:\n\nAt 2:40, Wood describes his biggest fear while working on the force.\n\n\n\nAt 6:20, he identifies the type of officers who are most likely to act irrationally in high-stress situations.\n\n\n\nAt 8:10, Wood pivots to a systemic problem throughout the force: how easily anger among officers can turn toxic.\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0b304235215b082e337"}}
