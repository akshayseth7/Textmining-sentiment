See what we did there?\n\nThe Donald made a trip to Laredo, Texas, located on the U.S.-Mexico border, where he confirmed that he still believes the U.S. should have a giant wall to discourage people from crossing the border illegally.\n\nSee also: Everyone is a loser in 'Trump For President: The Board Game'\n\nOn top of his statements (and his comb-over, incidentally), Trump wore a pristine white baseball cap that said, \"Make America Great Again\" on the front. Naturally, the Internet was ready and waiting to make as many jokes and memes as possible about his fashion choice.\n\nHonestly, he should probably wear a hat more often.\n\nTrump's hat photoshopped to be even Trumpier http://t.co/dJCiU19JUi pic.twitter.com/PD3AeG12YK \u2014 Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) July 23, 2015\n\nYo, @totalfratmove, y'all seen Trump's hat yet?
