The case has attracted national attention as the Philippines seeks closer defence ties with its longtime ally, the United States, in the face of Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nPemberton, who was 22 at the time, said Laude, 26, slapped him and caused him to respond \"in defence\", Ms Flores said.\n\nMr Harry Roque, a lawyer representing the victim's family at the trial, said the soldier testified that he held Laude in an \"armlock\" until she stopped moving.\n\n\"He then dragged her to (the) bathroom and dumped her,\" Mr Roque added.\n\nAnother lawyer for the victim's family, Ms Virgie Suarez, said Pemberton confessed to choking Laude at a motel room, but said he thought she was just unconscious.\n\nThe judicial proceedings will continue until December.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE", "_id": {"$oid": "55dc236804235215b082e4d4"}}
