Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is perhaps the most significant sign he will run.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly asked Warren, whose progressive message resonates with voters, to enter the race, but she has so far declined.\n\nThe 72-year-old Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2004 and is continuously mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHowever, speculation about him seeking the 2016 nomination grew after reports that son Beau Biden, before he died in May, asked his father to run again.\n\nIn addition, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers are dropping amid her email controversy, which has fueled talk about Biden entering the race.\n\nAnd a new Quinnipiac University survey shows Biden is performing as well or better than Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head match-ups in key swing states.\n\n\u201cThis isn't about anybody currently in the Democratic primary race,\u201d Alcorn said. \u201cThis is really about Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nAlcorn, whose super PAC has been around since March, acknowledged the importance of Biden entering the race before the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has an estimated $70 million, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the closest primary challenger, continues to do well in fundraising as he closes the polling gap.\n\n\u201cI think having the vice president on that debate stage is an important part of the campaign,\u201d Alcorn said.\n\nHowever, he declined to speculate about Biden\u2019s plans or schedule, saying the vice president was on his own timeline.\n\nAlcorn also said he didn\u2019t know about the details of the Warren meeting at the vice president\u2019s Washington residence. But he said Warren has \u201cincredible ideas on how to make the economy work for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's no surprise that he would want to talk to somebody like that,\u201d Alcorn told Fox. \u201cAnd I think talking with her is just another way to get some more ideas.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22004235215b082e437"}}
