Provided you can make it through the lingering pan across each member\u2019s NSFW bare ass without getting fired and tossed to the sidewalk, you\u2019ll find dates for the tour that kicks off in September. Perhaps the confused viewer sentiment is best summed up by the look on Pat Smear's face at the 2:50 mark, as well as YouTube commenter droidca9, who revives the old, \u201cIm 12 and what is this?!\u201d meme. Indeed, right now we are all 12 and what is this.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf11504235215b082e3a1"}}
