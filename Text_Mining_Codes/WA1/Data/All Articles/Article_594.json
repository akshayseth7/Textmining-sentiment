He informs the couple that their decision to turn away gay customers \u201cinspires me.\u201d The video ends with an invitation to an upcoming Iowa \u201crally for religious liberty\u201d\u2014hosted by Cruz, of course.\n\nA few corrections. First, the Gortz Haus Gallery is not a \u201cchurch,\u201d as Cruz repeatedly labels it. The gallery was a church, but when the Odgaards bought it, they converted it from a house of worship into a bistro, flower shop, art gallery, and wedding venue\u2014in other words, a business. Second, the video strongly implies that the Odgaard\u2019s business was forced to stop hosting all weddings because the state fined it into oblivion. That is not true. The Iowa Civil Rights Commissioned fined the Odgaards just $5,000\u2014and insisted that they must stop refusing service to same-sex couples. It was the latter ruling by which the Odgaards could not abide. Betty Odgaard says the gallery stopped hosting weddings because \u201cwe didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d In fact, the gallery stopped hosting weddings because the Odgaards couldn\u2019t bear to serve gay and bisexual clientele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf14a04235215b082e3ad"}}
