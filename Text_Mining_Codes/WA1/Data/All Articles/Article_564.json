As he begins to sing, he leans hard into the mic, closing his eyes and throwing down his best Michael Jackson splayed-leg dance moves. The crowd at the club looks on passively\u2014a woman smiles coyly, but the rest look bored, unmoved, even hostile. One person flings a drink at him. Finally, a grizzled clubgoer flicks open his cigarette lighter and tosses the lit Zippo at the stage. Rather than duck out of the way, the singer executes a tight spin and is engulfed in flames. All at once, the crowd goes wild, rising to their feet and jamming hard to the song as the ablaze performer dances and sings even more frantically. As the club keeps dancing, the singer exits, utterly spent and still, literally, on fire.\n\nThis is the plot of the music video for \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d the new No. 1 song in America. It\u2019s by Canadian singer, songwriter and producer Abel Tesfaye, who since 2010 has recorded as The Weeknd. Rarely has a music video so openly depicted a singer\u2019s wary, all-consuming relationship with his own audience. (Even Kurt Cobain was more indirect.) As recently as 12 months ago, The Weeknd was largely known for a lush, quirky brand of alternative R&B, mostly issued on mixtapes, and for avoiding the media circus that is a mainstream pop career. But as \u201cFace\u201d takes over the No. 1 spot on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart this week, the tonsorially unique singer goes the last mile in his self-immolating quest to transform himself\u2014from critically acclaimed, blogger-obsessing fetish object, to mass-appeal heir to Michael Jackson\u2019s throne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re going to sacrifice yourself at the altar of the marketplace, it might as well be with something as sumptuous as \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d one of the most irresistible songs of the year. It is what music-biz and radio-programmer folk refer to as a \u201cone-listen record,\u201d a single whose trajectory is obvious from the first play. From the moment \u201cFace\u201d leaked in late May, pop-watchers were frothing about its potential, and it spent the summer fulfilling its chart inevitability. At the early-June launch event for the new Apple Music, The Weeknd was given a live showcase to officially debut the track\u2014perhaps unsurprisingly, it wound up being the most-played song on Beats 1, Apple\u2019s new global radio station. After debuting on the Hot 100 nearly halfway into the Top 40, it never saw a down week\u2014notable in an era where singles tend to debut high on sales to rabid fans, then cool before maybe catching on later with casual listeners and radio. \u201cFace\u201d hurtled into the Top 10 in just two weeks, broke into the top three by mid-July, and was lying in wait behind OMI\u2019s chart-topper \u201cCheerleader\u201d by the start of August. After three weeks in the Hot 100\u2019s runner-up slot, it overtakes OMI\u2019s smash this week.\n\nWhile it may have broken too late in the season to wind up the official 2015 Song of Summer, \u201cFace\u201d sounds like it was made for hot weather. It\u2019s as combustible as its video. It hybridizes several Quincy Jones\u2013era Jackson tropes\u2014the spooky groove of \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d the uptempo force and power of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2019til You Get Enough\u201d\u2014with a stomping post-hip-hop beat and a blissed-out haze reminiscent of the Steve Miller Band\u2019s \u201cFly Like an Eagle.\u201d Indeed, the song is about the narcotic, numbing effect of a powerful sexual relationship, as embodied in its absurdist chorus: \u201cI can\u2019t feel my face when I\u2019m with you/But I love it.\u201d\n\nThis druggy theme is not far removed from Tesfaye\u2019s prior work. Born in 1990 to Ethiopian parents who\u2019d emigrated to the Toronto suburb Scarborough, young Abel began recording murky R&B punctuated by his keening falsetto in his late teens. In 2010, he uploaded to YouTube a few tracks recorded for a project originally titled The Weekend (with correct spelling\u2014Tesfaye dropped the third \u201ce\u201d after an acrimonious breakup with the Weekend project\u2019s founding producer). Those tracks made The Weeknd an immediate online sensation. In 2011 alone, Tesfaye dropped three indie mixtapes\u2014House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence\u2014but declined all interviews, shrouding in mystery who, or what, The Weeknd even was. Starting with Balloons, critics keyed into The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cnarcotics-focused, and occasionally downright frightening\u201d lyrics; Echoes of Silence even led off with a skeletal cover of Michael Jackson\u2019s most sex-shaming hit, \u201cDirty Diana.\u201d\n\nThese bleary-eyed tracks and morning-after themes caught a wave. In the wake of Kanye West\u2019s seminal, commercially suicidal 808s and Heartbreak, a certain brand of downbeat rap and soul\u2014eventually branded with the now widely regretted term \u201cPBR&B\u201d\u2014simultaneously recounted drug and sexual adventurism and expressed detached regret about such wickedness: the ultimate humblebrag. Even before Tesfaye signed to a major label, he caught the attention of his fellow Canadian Drake and made a cameo on the Toronto rapper\u2019s 2011 album Take Care, a totem of its emo-hip-hop moment.\n\nWith \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d The Weeknd has taken this dark, dazed loopiness and transformed it into pure pop. That transformation required an assist from several talented pros. Foremost among them is Max Martin\u2014a name you\u2019ve probably noticed in this No. 1 hits series quite a few times before. The Swedish \u00fcber-producer and songwriter behind all of Taylor Swift\u2019s chart-toppers, Martin now adds another one to his roster, bringing him closer to becoming the Hot 100\u2019s all-time top hitmaker (he\u2019s creeping up behind Beatles producer George Martin and songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney). Max Martin co-wrote \u201cFace\u201d with Tesfaye as well as several additional songsmiths, among them former Cardigans guitarist Peter Svensson; and he co-produced it with Iranian producer\u2013remixer Ali Payami (a guy who seems determined to work on all of my favorite songs this year\u2014Payami also cowrote Swift\u2019s superlative \u201cStyle\u201d). The Weeknd was hooked up with all of these hit specialists by Monte Lipman and Charlie Walk, the executives who lead dominant pop label Republic Records (part of the Universal empire). By Walk\u2019s own admission, they began plotting The Weeknd\u2019s pop conquest more than a year in advance.\n\nBeauty Behind the Madness, the album featuring these two songs, is set to appear later this month, and it will be the ultimate market test of Weekend v2.0. It\u2019s actually Tesfaye\u2019s second major-label album (third, if you count a 2012 repackaging of his three 2011 mixtapes as Trilogy). The Weeknd\u2019s 2013 major-label debut, Kiss Land, was essentially a bigger-budget version of the dark, forbidding mixtapes he had produced on his own; Republic gave Tesfaye the chance to get that sound fully out of his system. Kiss Land sold respectably but generated no hits\u2014a result that the Abel of two years ago didn\u2019t seem to mind. Whereas every move Tesfaye has made over the last year has indicated he is ready to shed his alt-R&B-cred persona. \u2018\u2018I felt I had to change who I was,\u2019\u2019 he told The New York Times\u2019 Jon Caramanica last month.\n\nSuch cred policing is not limited to the world of white rock stars\u2014hip-hop has also seen its share of contentious change-ups. The history of the Black Eyed Peas can be divided into a before time, when they styled themselves as crunchy \u201990s backpacker-rappers, and a multiplatinum decade in which they partnered with pop singer Fergie and earned the scorn of hip-hop heads. (They are now attempting to reverse the process.) And when OutKast made the shift from deep-south weirdos to chart-topping megastars, Andr\u00e9 3000 would throw shade at the duo\u2019s new fans who weren\u2019t followers from the beginning. But in general, black music over the last three decades has had a different, more pragmatic relationship with commercial achievement. As journalist and radio host Dan Charnas noted in his terrific 2010 rap history The Big Payback, the hip-hop community has always been more goal-oriented toward multiplatinum success, with black MCs and moguls profiting from the genre the way their white predecessors had co-opted and profited from rock and roll.\n\nIn a way, going full-Jacko was a smart end run around this entire crossover predicament for The Weeknd. Unlike Neil Young, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor or even OutKast, he doesn\u2019t seem to regard his pop success as a sideline or byway to some larger, less compromised project. He\u2019s already four Top 10 hits into what looks, to any reasonable observer, like a full career shift.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0fa04235215b082e38b"}}
