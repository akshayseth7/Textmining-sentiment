I knew him and I happened to be planning to be in Florida and I thought it'd be fun to go to his wedding, because it's always entertaining,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"Now that he's running for president, it's a little more troubling,\" Clinton added.\n\nTrump at last Thursday's GOP debate on Fox News said Clinton went to his wedding because of his past donations to the Clinton Foundation and former secretary of State.\"With Hillary Clinton, I said, \u2018Be at my wedding.\u2019 And she came to my wedding. You know why? She had no choice because I gave.\"\n\nIn an interview the following morning on the \"Today\" show, Trump said it was \"very nice\" the Clintons attended his wedding and he meant his remark as a joke. Trump has donated at least $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, which has faced intense scrutiny amid Clinton's nascent 2016 campaign, and Bill and Hillary Clinton were photographed at his 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss in Palm Beach.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daefe704235215b082e27d"}}
