July 1st was the hottest day in the U.K.\u2019s history\u2014the Guardian briefly had to pause its liveblog of the heatwave because its computer servers overheated. On July 31st, the city of Bandar-e Mahshahr, Iran reached an unfathomable heat index of 165\u00b0F, nearly a world record.\n\nAll this warmth on land is being driven by record-setting heat across large sections of the world\u2019s oceans. The NOAA report notes that the warmest 10 months of ocean temperatures on record have occurred in the last 16 months. This is mostly due to a near-record strength El Ni\u00f1o, but the current state of the global oceans has little historical precedent. Since it takes several months for the oceanic warmth of an El Ni\u00f1o to fully reach the atmosphere, 2016 will likely be warmer\u2014perhaps much warmer\u2014than 2015. And that poses grave implications for the world\u2019s ecosystems as well as humans.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently entered a new point in the Earth\u2019s climate history. According to reconstructions using tree rings, corals, and ice cores, global temperatures are currently approaching\u2014if not already past\u2014the maximum temperatures commonly observed over the past 11,000 years (i.e., the time period in which humans developed agriculture), and flirting with levels not seen in more than 100,000 years.\n\nBut this is the scary part: The current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any point since humans first evolved millions of years ago. Since carbon dioxide emissions lead to warming, the fact that emissions are increasing means there\u2019s much more warming yet to come. What\u2019s more, carbon dioxide levels are increasing really quickly. The rate of change is faster than at any point in Earth\u2019s entire 4.5 billion year history, likely 10 times faster than during Earth\u2019s worst mass extinction\u2014the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d\u2014in which more than 90 percent of ocean species perished. Our planet has simply never undergone the kind of stress we\u2019re currently putting on it. That stunning rate of change is one reason why surprising studies like the recent worse-than-the-worst-case-scenario study on sea level rise don\u2019t seem so far fetched.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c404235215b082e46a"}}
