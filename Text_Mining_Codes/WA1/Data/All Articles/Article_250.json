Removal of those links from Google\u2019s search results for the claimant\u2019s name spurred new news posts detailing the removals, which were then indexed by Google\u2019s search engine.\n\nGoogle refused to remove links to these later news posts, which included details of the original criminal offence, despite them forming part of search results for the claimant\u2019s name, arguing that they are an essential part of a recent news story and in the public interest.\n\nGoogle now has 35 days from the 18 August to remove the links from its search results for the claimant\u2019s name. Google has the right to appeal to the General Regulatory Chamber against the notice.\n\nDeputy commissioner David Smith said: \u201cThe European court ruling last year was clear that links prompted by searching on an individual\u2019s name are subject to data protection rules. That means they shouldn\u2019t include personal information that is no longer relevant.\u201d\n\nThe right to be forgotten ruling allows Europeans to apply to remove outdated information about them from search engine listings. Google has approximately a 90% market share of search in Europe, making it the primary focus of the rulings and watchdog attention.\n\nRelating to journalistic content\n\nIn the ICO\u2019s ruling Smith says that it is \u201cnot a case where the information is about an individual in public life or where making the information available would protect the public from improper or unprofessional conduct\u201d and that \u201cthe information is not reasonably current\u201d.\n\nHowever, the ruling says that the \u201ccommissioner accepts that the search results in this case relate to journalistic content\u201d and \u201cdoes not dispute that journalistic content relating to devisions to delist search results may be newsworthy and in the public interest\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat interest can be adequately and properly met without a search made on the basis of the complainant\u2019s name\u201d, the ruling concluded.\n\nGoogle alerted news organisations to early right to be forgotten link removals through its webmaster tools, which prompted some news organisations to detail which links had been removed in news updates.\n\nIn June the BBC detailed all the links removed to published BBC articles. The Telegraph also published details of link removals affecting its website.\n\nSmith said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. We understand that links being removed as a result of this court ruling is something that newspapers want to write about. And we understand that people need to be able to find these stories through search engines like Google. But that does not need them to be revealed when searching on the original complainant\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nGoogle did not respond to request for comment.\n\n\u2022 Right to be forgotten: Swiss cheese internet, or database of ruin?\n\n\u2022 EU to Google: expand \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 to Google.com", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef3904235215b082e251"}}
