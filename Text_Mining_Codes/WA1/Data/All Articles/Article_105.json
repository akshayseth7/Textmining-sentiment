A new survey from Britain suggests that the heterosexual assumption is less justified than ever, since the number of people who consider themselves completely heterosexual is in steep decline. It also challenges the pernicious and nonsensical debate over the existence of bisexuality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAccording to the poll, conducted by YouGov, when asked to plot themselves on a seven-point Kinsey scale, 72 percent of Britons identifed as exclusively heterosexual and 4 percent as exclusively homosexual, leaving 23 percent between those two extremes. When it comes to 18-to-24-year-olds, however, a whopping 49 percent chose an option other than \u201ccompletely heterosexual.\u201d\n\nThe percentage of respondents reporting a sexual experience with a person of the same sex was still relatively small\u201417 percent overall\u2014but attitudes to sexual identity and openness to bisexuality are clearly in transition.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee8404235215b082e1bf"}}
