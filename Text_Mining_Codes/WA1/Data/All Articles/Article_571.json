Before you can even begin to suss out its contours from within, you feel such pressure from without. Parents want to deny it. Your friends want to egg it on. Authorities want to control it. The media want to capitalize on it. Teenage boys, walloped by their own suddenly turbocharged libidos, want to bulldoze it. And grown men, who stare and follow and otherwise try to insinuate themselves into your confidence, want things that seem both terrifying and thrilling.\n\nLaura Miller Laura Miller is a books and culture columnist for Slate and the author of The Magician\u2019s Book: A Skeptic\u2019s Adventures in Narnia.\n\nBut what do teenage girls want? Stuck at the center of this maelstrom of other people\u2019s fears and fascination, how can they even tell? There has never been a better medium to explore this question than the novel, with its unfettered access to the interior recesses of the self. The inner life of a teenage girl can be like an unstable weather system, shot through with squalls, inexplicably balmy interludes, and stretches of drab rain. Writers have used first-person narration to chart this mercurial climate in books ranging from Jane Eyre to I Capture the Castle to Oranges are Not the Only Fruit. Carson McCullers\u2019 The Member of the Wedding (among others) proved that the third-person does justice to a teen girl\u2019s yearnings, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe movies can claim far fewer triumphs in this department. Partly this is the result of the medium itself, which can only show us the outsides of people and then encourage us to infer what\u2019s happening within. The outsides of pretty girls have long been one of film\u2019s favorite subjects, too, an interest that only occasionally extends to the girls\u2019 own thoughts and desires. Mena Suvari\u2019s cheerleader character in American Beauty is the archetype: mooned over as a sublime, rose-strewn ideal by Kevin Spacey\u2019s Lester Turnham, despite the girl\u2019s actual vapidity. Other teenage girls, like the titular sisters of The Virgin Suicides, are presented as ciphers to the men who long for or even possess them. The Jeffrey Eugenides novel on which it was based succeeds where the film fails in conveying how men\u2019s desires can sometimes blind them to women\u2019s humanity. Trained by a lifetime of watching films in which the surfaces of girls are all that matter, we moviegoers are sometimes blinded too. Lolita weeps inconveniently in the next room, and Humbert Humbert turns a deaf ear.\n\nThe outsides of pretty girls have long been one of film\u2019s favorite subjects.\n\nMinnie Goetze isn\u2019t a big crier, though. True, the main character and subject of Marielle Heller\u2019s exhilarating directorial debut The Diary of a Teenage Girl doesn\u2019t come out of her hair-raising adventures without shedding her fair share of tears, but those tears are not the point. Fifteen-year-old Minnie, played with gleaming intensity by Bel Powley, has an affair with her mother\u2019s boyfriend (twice her age), hooks up with guys from school, sleeps with a dangerously charming lesbian, and even briefly experiments with prostitution alongside her best friend Kimmie\u2014before both girls decide that was gross and vow never to do it again. Yet The Diary of a Teenage Girl is not, as you might expect from this pr\u00e9cis, a cautionary tale. Minnie is ravenous for experience, particularly of the erotic variety, and living with a hip, lackadaisical single mom (played by Kristen Wiig) in 1970s San Francisco, she has plenty of opportunities to satisfy her curiosity, and her lust.\n\nThere\u2019s something transgressive about even typing the word \u201clust\u201d in reference to a 15-year-old. Isn\u2019t \u201cShe wanted it!\u201d the habitual excuse of abusers and other skeevy men? It is, but pretending that 15-year-old girls never feel carnal desire, or only feel it toward appropriate partners, does another kind of damage. No doubt that\u2019s one reason why Heller has pursued this project so ardently, from the moment eight years ago when she first read the novel (told in comics and text) of the same title by Phoebe Gloeckner. Since then, Heller has retold Gloeckner\u2019s story in an off-Broadway stage production (in which she played Minnie), and now in a film, which she both wrote and directed. \u201cYou feel stupid for having these thoughts or feeling like they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Heller told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI just feel like this film is doing a service to young women, like, it\u2019s OK, you\u2019re all normal, you\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nMinnie\u2019s experience isn\u2019t every girl\u2019s, but it is entirely hers. The Diary of a Teenage Girl avoids the voyeurism that threatens any film about a young girl\u2019s sexuality by burying itself in Minnie\u2019s sensibility. At times, her drawings and doodles (she\u2019s an aspiring cartoonist) commandeer the screen, worming their way over the photographed images like ivy engulfing a stone wall. Cleverly, Heller has cast outrageously sexy actors in the roles of Minnie\u2019s lovers: Alexander Skarsgard as Monroe, her mother\u2019s feckless boyfriend, and Margarita Levieva as the lesbian junkie who finally takes Minnie to the limits of her daring. (It crossed my mind that their characters might \u201creally\u201d be far less attractive, and only Minnie, in her fever, sees them as Skarsgard and Levieva.)\n\nCourtesy of North Atlantic Books\n\nAbove all, the movie has Powley\u2019s face, which like Giulietta Masina\u2018s or Maria Falconetti\u2018s has the power to fill and transfigure the frame. With her huge, round, heavy-lidded eyes, Powley inhales and possesses the movie\u2019s point of view. Technically, we know her character is being taken advantage of, but on screen, she\u2019s the queen of her world\u2014an often goofy and callow queen, but a queen all the same. \u201cNobody loves you. Nobody sees you. Nobody touches you,\u201d Minnie tells herself, which is both the reason why her desire has enjoyed enough space to flourish on its own, and not quite true. The audience loves, sees, and inhabits her.\n\nHeller\u2019s version of The Diary of a Teenage Girl is several shades sunnier than Gloeckner\u2019s. The book is semi-autobiographical and some of its passages are lifted directly from Gloeckner\u2019s own girlhood diary; Gloeckner, too, had an affair with her mother\u2019s boyfriend. But while Glockner\u2019s Monroe is the initiator of the affair, Heller\u2019s version of the character serves more as a willing participant, albeit one who eventually lets Minnie down by refusing to fulfill her romantic dreams. (Basically, he\u2019s hung up on her mom.) Their clinches evolve out of bouts of boisterous horseplay, juvenile hijinks that make Monroe seem not much more than a big kid himself.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t of course, mean that Monroe isn\u2019t wrong to have sex with Minnie, however much she pesters him for it; he is in fact a statutory rapist. He has no right to decide that their relationship is acceptable, regardless of what Minnie says, and regardless of whether or not she suffers any lasting harm as the result of it. (Gloeckner has said that she regards the relationship that inspired her book as sexual abuse, \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t see the love I had for him. I actually really loved him. But I think that meant nothing for him, or he would laugh it off.\u201d)\n\nHowever, Monroe\u2019s abuse doesn\u2019t define Minnie, either. When other films\u2014Andrea Arnold\u2019s excellent 2009 feature Fish Tank comes to mind\u2014have dealt with similar relationships, we\u2019re meant to understand the girl as used, motivated by emotional rather than sexual hunger. Minnie, on the other hand, feels pleasure and wants more of it, seeking out casual trysts with a classmate who finds her passion disconcerting and says (in a paraphrase of the book), \u201cHaving sex with you kind of scares me.\u201d This prompts an animated fantasia in which a giant woman strides down a San Francisco street and scoops up a cowering male figure in her mammoth fist.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf10104235215b082e392"}}
