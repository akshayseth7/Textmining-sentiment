Blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s fury was sparked by Kelly\u2019s opening question, asking if calling women \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals\u201d is behavior befitting a president.\n\n\n\nTrump quipped that he had only called Rosie O\u2019Donnell those names, but Kelly said he had bad mouthed other women \u201cwell beyond\u201d the comedian.\n\nIn his earlier tweets, the fiery presidential hopeful even re-posted a tweet that called Kelly a \u201cbimbo.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to express his ire on Friday morning talk shows, insisting he \u201cdidn\u2019t say many of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m gonna have somebody call up and find out where some of these words came from because I don\u2019t recognize those words,\u201d he told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m an angel, by the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not that important. I have an interesting life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she feels she wants to do it that way, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s very professional,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it to Trump . . . I\u2019m very surprised that Fox News would do that. It\u2019s pretty unprofessional.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen, who is special counsel to Trump, went even further, telling Business Insider that Fox\u2019s coverage was \u201can organized attack\u201d on the tycoon.\n\n\u201cObviously, somebody, you know, doesn\u2019t want him to continue to rise in the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nKelly hasn\u2019t publicly responded to Trump\u2019s jabs.\n\nBut Fox News chairman Roger Ailes called the debate\u2019s three moderators, including Kelly, \u201cthe best political team ever put on television.\u201d\n\nKelly also got support from the only woman running for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn a related development, financier Carl Icahn tweeted Friday that he would accept Trump\u2019s offer to be Treasury secretary \u2014 assuming Trump becomes president \u2014 after turning it down in June.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf16e04235215b082e3c4"}}
