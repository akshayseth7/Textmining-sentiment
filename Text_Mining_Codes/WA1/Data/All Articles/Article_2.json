(Instead of slowing down the car, as Miller and Valasek did, they could speed it up.) Thousands or millions of Americans might suddenly fear traveling in their cars.\n\nSo here lies another way for terrorists, gangsters, rogue nations, or spies to make deadly mischief or wage cyberwar. When Miller and Valasek first discovered the vulnerability in the Jeep Cherokee\u2019s central computer, they scanned Sprint\u2019s cellular network, looking for cars with the same signature. Over the course of a few days, they found 2,400 cars (not just Jeep Cherokees) and were able to track their locations through GPS. If they\u2019d wanted, they could have hacked into any of those cars and taken over the steering, brakes, accelerator, or whatever.\n\nFinally, in the Jeep Cherokee, at least until recently, the purely internal computer\u2014the one that monitors the car\u2019s vital functions and makes slight adjustments, if necessary\u2014was wired into the computers hooked up to the cellular network or the Internet. In other words, anyone who hacked into the network would have access to everything. (This is the vulnerability that Chrysler is now patching in the 1.4 million vehicles it recalled. Miller says he doesn\u2019t know whether other car manufacturers link computers in this way.)\n\nHere\u2019s a thought for your next road trip: In the Jeep Cherokee (and probably many other cars, too), when the online diagnostic service is activated, the brake pedal is automatically deactivated, so that the mechanic can test the brakes. If a hacker turns on the diagnostic function while you\u2019re merrily speeding down the highway, the effect would be as if he slashed your brakes.\n\nIf hackers disrupted any of these links, they could wreak havoc: send false data to the Google Maps screen, make the car steer wildly (and not just during parallel parking), speed the car up or slow it down (and not just when it\u2019s tailgating), or blow out its tires.\n\nSecond, cars offer many points of entry to a skilled hacker. Most modern cars are filled to the gills with computer-controlled features. The most commonplace are GPS receivers and Google Maps screens, which by necessity are hooked up to the networks. But there are other network-connected functions, too. Many cars can parallel park automatically; to do this, a data link connects the computerized steering mechanism to sensors that measure the car\u2019s distance to the curb and to other nearby cars. Similar data links are needed for functions that reduce a car\u2019s speed if it starts to tailgate, or that inflate a car\u2019s tires if their pressure gets too low. Some cars offer online diagnostic services, so a mechanic can examine and adjust the car\u2019s brakes or transmission\u2014or basically anything about its internal workings\u2014from many miles away.\n\nFirst, the Jeep Cherokee is hardly the only hackable car out there. Miller and his colleague, Chris Valasek, chose it because it seemed to be a particularly easy target and because its price tag fell within their project\u2019s budget. \u201cI doubt other cars have their exact vulnerabilities,\u201d Miller told me, \u201cbut there\u2019s no reason to think that they don\u2019t have some sorts of vulnerabilities.\u201d Then he delivered the punchline: \u201cProbably they all do\u201d\u2014that is, probably all modern cars are vulnerable to cyberintrusion.\n\nA happy ending to a hair-raising story? No, it turns out, not at all. In early August, the two hackers released a 90-page technical paper at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, explaining exactly how they\u2019d found and exploited the Jeep Cherokee\u2019s vulnerabilities\u2014and outlined a number of disturbing implications. I also talked with one of the paper\u2019s authors, Charlie Miller, who drew a few more scary observations.\n\nLast month, Wired published an article with a headline that sounds like absurdist science fiction: \u201c Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway\u2014With Me in It .\u201d Two security specialists had figured out how to hack into a Jeep Cherokee\u2019s onboard computers. As an experiment, writer Andy Greenberg took one out on the road, at which point the hackers commandeered the car\u2019s air conditioner, radio, windshield wipers, and\u2014most distressingly\u2014its accelerator and brakes. If they\u2019d wanted to wreck the car or kill the driver, they easily could have.\n\nOr imagine that the car carrying a certain individual\u2014a head of state, ambassador, nuclear scientist, or the No. 3 al-Qaida leader\u2014smashes into oncoming traffic, crashes into a tree, or careens off a bridge. It would be targeted assassination\u2014like a drone strike, but without the drone or the smart bomb it carries. The target is dead, and all appearances would suggest that the driver simply lost control of his vehicle.\n\nWelcome to the world of the Internet of Things, in which every household appliance\u2014and, it seems, cars\u2014can be a carrier of malicious software. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising. As far back as 1996, three analysts with the Terrorism Research Center co-wrote a paper titled \u201cInformation Terrorism: Can You Trust Your Toaster?\u201d They were being facetious, sort of, but they\u2019ve proved prescient. (One of the authors, Matthew Devost, is now president of FusionX, one of the leading cybersecurity companies.)\n\nOr go back further. In the mid-1960s, when the ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet) was about to roll out, a few computer scientists warned that placing information on a network\u2014with online access from many users in unsecured locations\u2014would create inherent vulnerabilities. Countless commissions, panels, and studies issued similar warnings in the ensuing decades\u2014vindicated by countless simulations, war games, and actual hackings (which have been going on for a lot longer than most people think). Yet this didn\u2019t stop networks from proliferating in all realms of life, not least in \u201ccritical infrastructures\u201d\u2014gas, electric, rail lines, waterworks, and so forth\u2014which are almost all operated by computerized supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, systems.\n\nThese SCADA systems, network-connected cars, the Internet of Things, and the Internet itself all came into being for the same reasons: efficiency and convenience. Scientists wanted to share research without operating more than one computer console. Utility companies want to centralize the distribution and flow of resources. Busy families want their thermostats adjusted when the house gets too hot or cold and want their refrigerators restocked when they\u2019re low on food, without going to the trouble themselves. And drivers want to parallel park without learning how.\n\nCorporations are happy to comply; the technology makes it possible and, with economies of scale, fairly cheap. No one built in provisions for security, because no one thought doing so was necessary\u2014not in the early phases of each new thing; and once the early phase passed, once the new thing was commonplace, drastic changes were all but impossible.\n\nThe Wired experiment wasn\u2019t even the first time someone pointed out the vulnerabilities of the computers inside cars. In 2011, a team of scientists at the University of Washington and University of California\u2013San Diego wrote a paper warning of this problem, though, with the discretion of academics, they didn\u2019t identify the sedan that they\u2019d hacked. That paper inspired Miller and Valasek, in 2012, to hack into a Toyota Prius and a Ford Escape (purchased with a research grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). But in that test, they plugged their laptops into the car\u2019s computer while they drove it around a parking lot. The novelty of the Wired test was that they did the hacking entirely online\u2014through radio, cellular, and Wi-Fi signals\u2014and on a real road. That was what woke up at least some of the industry.\n\nSo are we doomed to the hackable car? Not necessarily. For one thing, Miller told me, \u201cHacking a car is a lot harder than hacking a computer.\u201d It took him and Valasek a year to find the Jeep Cherokee\u2019s vulnerabilities and devise ways to exploit them. And, it should be noted, Miller is not your everyday recreational hacker. He\u2019s in charge of computer security at Twitter; and before then, from 2000\u20132005, he worked in Tailored Access Operations\u2014the elite corps of hackers inside the National Security Agency. When the president wants to hack into a terrorist\u2019s email, contaminate a foreign network, or (in the case of the Stuxnet operation) sabotage an Iranian nuclear facility, TAO gets it done.\n\nI asked Miller whether he could have hacked into the Jeep Cherokee more quickly if he\u2019d still been able to draw on the resources of TAO. He said that he supposed he could. I also asked him whether, to his knowledge, TAO had ever gone after a target by exploiting software vulnerabilities in a car. He said that it hadn\u2019t. But the point is, it\u2014or some foreign equivalent\u2014could, and it would be surprising if some spy agency, somewhere, isn\u2019t at least looking into the possibilities. No doubt copycat hackers are doing the same, if just to show that they can.\n\nCar companies could take some mitigating measures. For instance, they could install firewalls between strictly internal computers and those hooked up to networks. There\u2019s no reason for a steering wheel to be hooked up to a network; if you don\u2019t know how to parallel park, learn. Online diagnostic services could be encrypted, with the codes changed periodically. (Miller and Valasek simply bought Chrysler\u2019s diagnostic manuals for a few thousand dollars.) It should also be possible to program these services so that they can\u2019t be activated unless the car is standing still.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee0004235215b082e15a"}}
