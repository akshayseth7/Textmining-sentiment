After all, even the most vocal or critical of customers can be won over if your business shows how much it values their feedback.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take away the fact that bad reviews can hurt. In recent cases, we\u2019ve seen business owners fight back against those who have given them negative, one-star reviews. The question is: is it worth the battle? And what weighs more heavily: a business\u2019 ability to have the last say and defend itself from criticism, or its ability to extinguish fires and prevent long-term damage to reputation? Let\u2019s check out some extreme examples:\n\nPark Italian Gourmet\n\nPark Italian Gourmet in New York is owned by Francesco Macri, who is actually terrific at responding to positive reviews. He\u2019s kind, humble, grateful, and , if necessary, apologetic \u2013 always thanking people for compliment-filled reviews and promising customers he\u2019ll do better in lieu of a bad day.\n\nBut in the face of scathing reviews, Macri isn\u2019t afraid of telling Yelpers that they\u2019re idiots, or they\u2019re full of s**t. Check out some of the responses he has written to one- or two-star reviews on Yelp.\n\nThe second response, by the way, translates to \u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot. You\u2019re in Brooklyn, please.\u201d\n\nTsk, tsk. Not good! There\u2019s another critical review to which Macri responds, \u201cThere is an overall douche-baggery to your review that makes me unsympathetic, and ultimately content that you didn\u2019t have a good experience.\u201d\n\nGaia Italian Caf\u00e9\n\nGaia Italian Caf\u00e9, also in New York, actually receives great, mostly 4- or 5-star reviews on Yelp, where the establishment has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 500 reviews (and counting). The occasional negative review Gaia does receive is typically not received warmly.\n\nALSO check out: \u201cHow NOT to Respond to Online Reviews (or How to Get People to Hate Your Business)\n\nAfter someone complained about overcooked pasta, owner Gaia Bagnasacco wrote, \u201cWhere are the educated customers? Where are the people who understand quality and what we are doing?\u201d Here are a few more \u201cI\u2019m fighting back\u201d responses:\n\nAlden & Harlow\n\nYou might have heard about this story earlier this month, wherein Chef Michael Scelfo of Alden & Harlow took to Instagram to shame a couple of \u201centitled,\u201d \u201cinsulting\u201d Yelpers. Scelfo explained the situation in the caption of his Instagram post, which has since been deleted:\n\nWe tried to have them leave, they refused. Taking their drink away and being forceful is not hospitable. So in lieu of calling the police (only other recourse imo) which seemed [too] strong a response, we opted to kill them with kindness until they left. \u2026 My choice to post this is not to slander them per [se] but to call attention to a major flaw in the current \u201conline review system & entitled mentality\u201d. Ultimately, it\u2019s about protecting the integrity of our (well documented) humble and gracious staff. Feel free to vilify me for posting, but I stand by my post.\n\nThe Instagram post came with the hashtag #wedontnegotiatewithyelpers.\n\nEveryone is calling Chef Scelfo a hero. One reader commented, \u201cEntitled jerks who treat the staff like garbage need to be called out more often, especially in the restaurant industry. Too often these people get away with this horrible behavior by making threats, but it\u2019s time to let people know that the customer is not always right and you can\u2019t get whatever you want by being a demanding little brat.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cI want those two jokers or whoever the real culprits are banned from Yelp!\u201d\n\nIs it worth fighting back?\n\nWhile some consumers will continue to encourage responses such as the ones Macri, Bagnasacco, and Scelfo have posted \u2013 after all, it\u2019s simply a case of business owners fighting back against abusive customers \u2013 industry experts believe that businesses ought to respond in ways that are less vengeful and more diplomatic.\n\n\u201cWhen a business owner behaves this way with customers, rather than vice versa, the power dynamic shifts,\u201d wrote the Boston Globe\u2019s Devra First. \u201cThere are other ways to rectify the situation. For instance, had the women carried through with a bad Yelp review (it doesn\u2019t appear they did), the restaurant might have gone to the site and posted a reply in kind.\n\n\u201cA restaurant being rated is a business, an organization. An individual being rated is a person.\u201d\n\nAdded a Daily Mail reader: \u201cIn reading reviews, I know there are always people who won\u2019t be happy about their meals, but I still may go. If I read a rant by a chef or owner against a poster\u2026.I will NEVER go to that business, for fear what they might do to meals they prepare.\u201d\n\nAnd from an Eater reader: \u201cThe measure of a great chef is not how they handle the good guests, but how they handle the bad ones.\u201d\n\nIndeed. At the end of the day, the more significant impact on the bottom line will be made by the way a business responds to feedback \u2013 and not what one or two hard-to-please customers have said on the Internet. So, the next time you receive an unfair one-star review and feel like lashing out, remember that, while you have the right to defend your business, there is hardly anything positive that will come out of criticizing customers.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to more effectively manage online reviews and build your online reputation, give us a call and our friendly team will show you how to get started.
