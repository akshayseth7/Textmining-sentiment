The real estate mogul said that if he were president he would change the tax code to force those who work for hedge funds to pay more.\n\n\u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are energetic. They are very smart. But a lot of them\u2014they are paper-pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It\u2019s ridiculous, ok?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump said his plan to make hedge fund managers pay more tax was part of his effort to \u201csave the middle class\u201d by lowering their tax rates. \u201cI want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one. They\u2019re getting absolutely destroyed. This country, it won\u2019t have a middle class very soon.\u201d In criticizing the tax that hedge fund managers pay, Trump was referring to what is known as the \u201ccarried interest loophole.\u201d Reuters explains that it is the \u201cprovision in the tax code which allows private equity and hedge fund managers pay taxes at the capital gains rate instead of the ordinary income rate.\u201d Trump, however, failed to specify how he would reform the tax code and change that provision.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2ee04235215b082e471"}}
