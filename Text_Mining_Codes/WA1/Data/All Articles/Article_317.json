But few have taken the idea as far as James Willis, whose floppy drive orchestra is so cleverly arranged I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see people DJing with these soon.\n\nSixteen drives, synchronized by a miRIO and wirelessly controlled with an iPad. For his five-song demo, Willis went the extra mile and hooked up a monitor loaded with visuals \u2014 because of course, the Imperial March wouldn\u2019t be complete without footage of Red Leader peering into his 8-bit targeting computer to bust up the Death Star, now, would it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if 2D visuals aren\u2019t your thing \u2014 if, say, the occasion calls for a Daft Punk power helmet \u2014 just rig up a second miRIO and go for it. Willis has all the details you need to start building your own floppy orchestra right here.\n\n[YouTube]\n\nContact the author at maddie.stone@gizmodo.com or follow her on Twitter.\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf00104235215b082e294"}}
