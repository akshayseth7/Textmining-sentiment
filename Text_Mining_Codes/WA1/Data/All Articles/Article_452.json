Starting in October, the clothing brand\u2019s parent company Fast Retailing will offer the option of a four-day workweek to roughly 10,000 full-time employees in Japan, Bloomberg reports. Those who accept the schedule will gain three days off by working 10-hour shifts the other four days. (I hesitate to use the phrase \u201cthree-day weekend\u201d because, per Bloomberg, employees will have to work Saturdays and Sunday to keep stores staffed.) If the trial goes well, the company will consider phasing in a shorter workweek at its corporate headquarters as well as in more retail stores.\n\nSitting at a computer monitor on this lovely summer Friday, three days off in exchange for 10-hour days sounds rather nice. But will Uniqlo\u2019s employees in Japan actually want it? Bloomberg says Fast Retailing \u201cis offering the perk to its in-store employees with the hope of retaining full-time talent, who often cut down to part time to be with their families or care for elderly parents.\u201d Still, consider the well-documented portrait of the Japanese workaholic. Long, often unpaid overtime hours are expected as a matter of course. Working to death is so common that Japanese courts have recognized it as a legitimate cause of action in wrongful death suits and it\u2019s literally been enshrined in the lexicon\u2014the term is karoshi. To get the nation to ease up, the Japanese government is thinking about legally requiring workers to take their PTO. Uniqlo might have to drag its employees off the clock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf09a04235215b082e31b"}}
