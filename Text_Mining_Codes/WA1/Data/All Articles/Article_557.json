In \u201cMC Mom,\u201d a college student gets a DVD labeled \u201cTo my fresh dope son, from MC Mom\u201d in the mail from his mother. His delighted roommates insist on watching the homemade music video, in which the sweater-vest-clad middle-aged matriarch raps a dispatch from home to her embarrassed son. Like the best Key & Peele sketches, this one has more than one twist, as MC Mom segues into a mocking riff on all the \u201ccrispy socks\u201d in her son\u2019s bedroom, all before she really goes in. Consider \u201cMC Mom\u201d a retort to the tired comedy trope of the clueless parent trying to rap (which doesn\u2019t make much sense anymore, considering that many of today\u2019s parents grew up listening to hip-hop).\n\n\n\nLongtime Key & Peele fans will appreciate the callback to Season 3 in the kicker.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0f204235215b082e384"}}
