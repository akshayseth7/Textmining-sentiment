They speak in an occult patois, they garb themselves in strange robes, and they work through the witching hour. Seen from the outside, youth is a secret society, and like all secret societies, it is equal parts contemptible, comical, and compelling.\n\nThis, at any rate, is the premise satirized by Millennials to Snake People, a new extension for Google\u2019s Chrome browser that does more or less what it says on the tin, changing every instance of the word millennial on Web pages to snake person. As the extension\u2019s author, Eric W. Bailey, winkingly explains, it \u201creveals the real truth behind\u201d the loosely defined, much discussed generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMillennials to Snake People follows in the footsteps of a handful of similar extensions that playfully \u201cfix\u201d the language of the Internet. Last year, Slate\u2019s Will Oremus extolled the merits of one that replaces every instance of the word literally\u2014including those that are technically correct\u2014with figuratively. And it has a more direct antecedent in Millennials Begone! which replaces millennial with pesky whipper-snapper.\n\nUltimately, neither Millenials to Snake People nor Millennials Begone! are making fun of the generation they pretend to mock. Instead, they\u2019re parodying the way the way the media reports on millennials, capturing the weird attitude of geriatric demonology that inflects so many attempts to understand the young. These obsessive attempts to classify and characterize are ultimately empty gestures of control, attempts to regulate by naming and describing.\n\nIn this regard, it\u2019s the little details that make Millennials to Snake People shine. Seen through the extension\u2019s filter, one paragraph of the Terminology section of Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cMillennials\u201d article reads, \u201cSeveral alternative names have been proposed by various people: Caduceus Cult, Tannin\u2019s Horde, Time of Nidhogg and the Damballa\u2019s Coils,\u201d referring to, among other things, a biblical sea serpent, a Norse dragon, and a powerful Haitian loa. These relatively obscure terms play off the similarly unfamiliar quality of the categories they replace, categories like \u201cgeneration men\u201d and \u201cgeneration next\u201d that failed to capture the public imagination.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf01d04235215b082e2b4"}}
