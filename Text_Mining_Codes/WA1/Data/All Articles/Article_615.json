Although, he said in his statement that he had yet to be contacted by officials in the U.S. or Zimbabwe.\n\nTwo Zimbabweans have been arrested in the case: Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who is alleged to have taken Palmer to the area, and Honest Trymore Ndlovu, the owner of the land where Cecil was allegedly killed.\n\nAmong the insults directed at Palmer are calls for hunting to be banned.\n\nPresenter Jimmy Kimmel started choking up during an impassioned speech about Cecil on his show, which ended with an appeal for donations to the Oxford University program that had been tracking Cecil as part of a conservation program.\n\nWhile calling Palmer an \"a-hole dentist\" and a \"jackal,\" Kimmel said, \"I don't think the answer is to start a witchhunt for the guy...\"\n\nPalmer isn't the first, and will no doubt be the last, hunter whose pastime is vilified online.\n\nTexan cheerleader Kendall Jones incurred the wrath of the Internet last year after posting photos of herself to Facebook, boasting about her biggest kills. Her Facebook page is still attracting abusive comments.\n\nAn image of Kendall Jones, a cheerleader vilified online for images of her posing with dead animals.\n\nThere were also calls to ban Wildlife presenter Melissa Bachman from South Africa, after she posted a photo of herself posing next to a dead lion in 2013. A Facebook page called \"Stop Melissa Bachman\" now has 357,000 members and is still being regularly updated.\n\nPast examples suggest that the outcry over the latest trophy hunter's kill is unlikely to die down any time soon.\n\n\"I believe that sorry dentist #WalterPalmer is hearing the lion's roar about now,\" tweeted musician and actress Juliette Lewis.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf16804235215b082e3be"}}
