Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2015\n\nThey\u2019re not wrong!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJeb first used the term earlier this week while weighing in on birthright citizenship\u2014 the granting of citizenship to anyone born in the country\u2014which has become the latest topic du jour in the GOP race in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to end it. Bush is against going that far, but says that the U.S. government should do a better job of preventing pregnant women from crossing the border to have their children. \u201cThat\u2019s [the] legitimate side of this,\u201d the GOP hopeful said on Bill Bennett\u2019s conservative radio show on Wednesday. \u201cBetter enforcement so that you don\u2019t have these, you know, \u2018anchor babies,\u2019 as they\u2019re described, coming into the country.\u201d\n\nAs you can tell by the \u201cyou know\u201d that preceded the term, and the \u201cas they\u2019re described\u201d that followed, the words anchor babies didn\u2019t exactly roll off Bush\u2019s tongue. That\u2019s probably because, according to the Washington Post, it was the first time he\u2019s uttered the term publicly on the campaign trail. It\u2019s difficult to say whether Jeb intentionally decided to drop \u201canchor baby\u201d into his talking point in a bid to appeal to immigration hard-liners or if it simply slipped out. (I\u2019ve listened to the clip a dozen times, and could be convinced of either.) Regardless, he has decided to try to own it. Given the chance to walk it back on Thursday, Bush pressed ahead. \"Do you have a better term? You give me a better term and I'll use it,\" he snapped at a reporter.\n\nHow about \"babies,\" \"children,\" or \"American citizens.\" https://t.co/ofxEG6Za00 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 20, 2015", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeefb04235215b082e21c"}}
