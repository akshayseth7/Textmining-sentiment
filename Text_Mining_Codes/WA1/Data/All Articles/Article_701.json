Well, you\u2019re in luck: London\u2019s glass-encased, 82-foot-long \u201csky pool\u201d is perfect for you.\n\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\n\nThe proposed sky pool\u2014which is expected to be completed by 2018\u2014will exist as a kind of bridge between two residential buildings in Embassy Gardens, a 2,000-home complex near the American Embassy in London\u2019s Nine Elms district. It\u2019s the brainchild of Sean Mulryan, the chairman and CEO of Ballymore Group, which developed the complex. But the aquarium-like structure needed an actual aquarium designer, as well as a team of glass and marine designers, to help out Arup Associates, the pool\u2019s designers.\n\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group\n\n\u201cMy vision for the sky pool stemmed from a desire to push the boundaries in the capability of construction and engineering. I wanted to do something that had never been done before,\u201d Mulryan, told Home and Property. \u201cIt will feel like floating through the air in central London.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhile a gimmick like the sky pool seems like it was created to go viral, some, such as Henry Pryor, a buying agent for wealthy clients, are skeptical of its actual appeal. He told the Guardian that he thought the plans for the pool were \u201cgenuinely crackers\u201d and wondered if enough people would actually be interested in swimming in it.\n\nCourtesy of Ballymore Group", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1cf04235215b082e414"}}
