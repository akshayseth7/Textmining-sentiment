Ever since scoring his first Top 10 single as a solo artist with \u201cEarned It,\u201d off the Fifty Shades soundtrack, in February, he\u2019s been a fixture at the top of the charts. Earlier this month, he scored his first No. 1, with the Off the Wall-esque \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d and he currently has two songs in the Top 5 at the same time. The arrival of his new album, Beauty Behind the Madness, next week, seems destined to represent the arrival of a new megastar.\n\n\n\nNow, just in time for the weekend (get it?), the R&B singer-songwriter-producer has shared an extended preview of that new album, in the form of an 18-minute mix, stitching together every song on the album, called \u201cThe Leak\u201d:", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee7a04235215b082e1bb"}}
