Obtaining an account from that domain became a symbol of status within the family\u2019s inner circle, conferring prestige and closeness to the secretary.\n\nChelsea Clinton was given one, but under a pseudonym, Diane Reynolds, which she frequently used when she checked into hotels. Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s longtime aide and surrogate daughter, was also given a coveted clintonemail.com address.\n\nAnd Mrs. Clinton used this private address for everything \u2014 from State Department matters to planning her daughter\u2019s wedding and issues related to the family\u2019s sprawling philanthropic foundation.\n\nSix years later, as Mrs. Clinton prepares for a 2016 presidential campaign, her exclusive use of her clintonemail.com address while secretary of state has set off intense criticism, because it shielded her correspondence from being searched in response to public records requests at the State Department. The practice has also raised questions about whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email was vulnerable to security risks and hacking.\n\nAt the request of the State Department, Mrs. Clinton turned over about 50,000 pages of emails from clintonemail.com related to the government issues late last year. But her aides have declined to describe the process by which they selected which emails to hand over and which to hold back, and public records experts have expressed alarm that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s correspondence was not being preserved as part of the State Department record-keeping system while she was in office.\n\nLate Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said in a Twitter message that she had asked the State Department to release her emails and that they would review them for release as soon as possible. \u201cI want the public to see my email,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cIt seems her intent was to create a system where she could personally manage access to her communications,\u201d said John Wonderlich, policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advocates transparency in government.\n\n\u201cGiven all the power she had as secretary of state, a lot of that work would be jumbled together,\u201d Mr. Wonderlich said. \u201cHer presidential ambitions and the family foundation would be wrapped up technically in email.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s allies have maintained that she followed protocol in the use of a private email address. A spokesman declined to elaborate on Wednesday about her use of clintonemail.com for matters related to the Clinton Foundation, which has received millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments. The foundation ceased to accept most donations from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was at the State Department but began the practice again after she left office in February 2013.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an email of talking points to supporters, Burns Strider, a senior adviser to Correct the Record, a group that defends Mrs. Clinton in the news media, pointed out that former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, also a likely 2016 presidential candidate, also hosts his own personal email server.\n\nMr. Bush is a prolific user of email who continued to use his personal jeb.org domain, which his aides could also access, while he was in the governor\u2019s office, said Kristy Campbell, Mr. Bush\u2019s spokeswoman. Under Florida\u2019s records laws, emails from Mr. Bush\u2019s personal account have been made public. \u201cHis emails were available via public records requests throughout his time in office and have remained available,\u201d Ms. Campbell said.\n\nIn earlier years, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account at clintonemail.com was connected to a server registered to the Clintons\u2019 Chappaqua home in the name of Eric P. Hothem. Mr. Hothem, a former aide to the Clintons, now works in finance in Washington, according to regulatory disclosure documents.\n\nMr. Hothem, whose name was misspelled in Internet records, did not return a message left on Wednesday with an assistant at his office. Mr. Cooper, whose name is on the clintonemail.com domain registration, now works at Teneo Holdings, a corporate advisory firm with a broad array of global business clients partly run by Douglas J. Band, a former adviser to Bill Clinton.\n\nThe Clintons eventually decided they did not want all three family members on the same email domain, in part, an adviser said, out of concern that it might look as if Mrs. Clinton\u2019s official business at the State Department was too closely overlapping with Mr. Clinton\u2019s work as a global philanthropist. Mr. Clinton stuck with presidentclinton.com, which was established in 2002. Chelsea Clinton has now set up chelseaoffice.com. The clintonemail.com domain is set to expire in 2017, when Mrs. Clinton, if successful in her presumptive campaign for president, would take office.\n\nIn addition to concerns that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private emails are not subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, there are also questions about how secure her personal email address was as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cShe obviously would have been targeted when she stepped outside of the secure State Department networks,\u201d said Tom Kellermann, a cybersecurity expert with Trend Micro. He said her use of her own email server instead of her government account, with its built-in security systems, would be akin to her leaving her bodyguard in a dangerous place. The unintended consequence, he said, is that Mrs. Clinton may have \u201cundermined State Department security.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a congressional committee examining the 2012 attacks in Benghazi sent a subpoena to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyers for all of her emails related to Libya. The committee sent the broad subpoena because it is seeking to determine whether Mrs. Clinton has handed over all of her correspondence about the attacks. Three weeks ago, the State Department provided the committee with roughly 900 pages of emails that the department said had come from her personal account. The committee also sent letters to Internet firms, telling them they were legally obligated \u201cto protect all relevant documents\u201d related to the Benghazi attacks.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1c904235215b082e40d"}}
