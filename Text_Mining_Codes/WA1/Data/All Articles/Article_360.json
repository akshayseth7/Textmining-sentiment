Trump continues to gain support, his hard line on immigration has driven rivals to match his biting anti-immigrant language and positions long considered extreme. It risks another general election cycle in which Hispanics view the party as unfriendly no matter who the nominee is, Republican strategists warned.\n\nThis week, several of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, echoed his call to end automatic citizenship for the American-born children of undocumented immigrants, repealing a constitutional right dating from the Civil War era.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for mass deportations \u2014 \u201cThey have to go,\u201d he said \u2014 which is supported by a sizable minority of Republican voters nationwide, has encouraged rivals to similarly push the edges on immigration.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill last month named for a woman who was shot to death in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant, a case first highlighted by Mr. Trump. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana went further, saying mayors of sanctuary cities \u2014 where local law enforcement officials decline to cooperate in federal deportations \u2014 should be arrested as accomplices when illegal immigrants commit felonies.\n\nNational Republican strategists warn that catering to the most hard-line voters on immigration in the nominating contest will hurt the party in the general election, as it did the 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, who endorsed \u201cself-deportation\u201d for illegal immigrants and attracted historically low Latino support.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans want to be competitive in the general election, they have to distance themselves from Trump on both illegal and legal immigration,\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, an official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration and the executive director of the American Principles Project\u2019s Latino Partnership, a conservative group. \u201cHis proposal on birthright citizenship is very insulting to Latinos, and every day, this is the top story on Spanish language media. Right now, if the other candidates don\u2019t respond to Trump, Latinos will buy the argument that Republicans agree with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemographics suggest Republicans have an even bigger challenge with Latinos in 2016 than in previous elections. The number of Latino voters has been growing rapidly. The population of Latinos eligible to vote by 2016 is expected to increase by 18 percent over 2012 to about 28 million people, more than 11 percent of voters nationwide, according to projections by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, a nonpartisan organization.\n\nMr. Walker, who led in Iowa polls for months before being eclipsed recently by Mr. Trump, took a harder anti-immigration position on Monday by seeming to support an end to birthright citizenship during a visit to the Iowa State Fair.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line positions, including seizing remittances sent by undocumented workers to Mexico and severely restricting legal immigration, are allowing some rivals to define themselves more clearly in opposition to him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called Mr. Trump\u2019s plan \u201cgibberish\u201d at the Iowa fair on Monday, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get 11 million people and drive them back out of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not practical. That\u2019s going to kill the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor now, the major Republican candidates who are relative moderates on immigration \u2014 Mr. Graham, Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 do not have the momentum or the news media attention enjoyed by Mr. Trump, who is not only denouncing illegal immigrants in nativist language but seeking severe limits on legal immigration. And his calls to deport illegal immigrants are resonating with many voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m O.K. with that,\u201d said Jessie McInville, a medical technologist from Urbandale, Iowa. \u201cWe all have to abide by our laws.\u201d Her husband, Jason, who said he twice voted for Mr. Obama for president, agreed.\n\nBruce Anderson, a farmer and auctioneer from Orion, Ill., agreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to restrict legal immigration on the ground it has taken jobs from citizens. \u201cAll immigration should be shut down in America for a while,\u201d Mr. Anderson said.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult issue for the Republican Party is Mr. Trump\u2019s call to deport not only all illegal immigrants, but also young people who came to this country as children and have received protections though executive actions by Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep the families together, but they have to go,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview, broadcast on Sunday, aboard his jet at the Des Moines airport.\n\nIt is an issue that other Republicans had tried to duck, focusing on securing the southern border. At the first Republican debate for the bottom seven candidates in the polls, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas framed the issue typically, saying that only when the border is sealed tight will Washington be \u201cup to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally.\u201d\n\nContinue reading the main story First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\nA sizable core of Republicans favors such mass deportations, including 43 percent in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. But that position is out of step with three-fourths of Americans \u2014 including 76 percent of independents \u2014 who believe illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country if certain conditions are met, according to a Pew Research Center survey in June. And a narrow majority of Republicans favor giving undocumented immigrants a path to legal status or citizenship.\n\nRepresentative Steve King of Iowa, one of Congress\u2019s most hawkish Republicans on immigration, discounted concerns that the issues raised by Mr. Trump would hurt the party\u2019s brand.\n\n\u201cThey often say anytime you don\u2019t pander to Hispanics, you cost Republican votes,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Trump gets stronger with this position that says enforce our immigration laws.\u201d\n\nNo matter who emerges as the Republican nominee, experts in Hispanic voting say many will remember the harsh anti-immigrant tone of the primaries. That was a lesson top Republican strategists drew from 2012, writing in a self-critical \u201cautopsy\u201d that called on the party to enact comprehensive immigration reform in Congress \u2014 or continue being swamped in general elections by the growing Latino vote.\n\nWell before Mr. Trump came along, his current rivals were toughening their immigration stances. Mike Huckabee, who as governor of Arkansas supported a state Dream Act giving in-state college tuition for undocumented students, said in March in Iowa that he wanted to \u201cstem the tide\u201d of people from Mexico who have \u201cheard there\u2019s a bowl of food just across the border.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker, who in 2013 favored a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, reversed himself this year, telling Fox News, \u201cMy view has changed; I\u2019m flat-out saying it.\u201d\n\nRyan Call, a former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, noted that Republicans like Senator Cory Gardner won election in the state in 2014 by opening a \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d with Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s plan and rhetoric takes us in exactly the opposite direction and will undermine much of the progress we have made in reaching out to the growing population of Hispanics and immigrants in Colorado and in other battleground states,\u201d Mr. Call said.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02b04235215b082e2bf"}}
