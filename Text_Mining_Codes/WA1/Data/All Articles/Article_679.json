That law, signed by Gov. Chris Christie in 2013, forbids any licensed therapist from attempting to \u201cconvert\u201d minors from gay to straight. (Gender conversion therapy, which is sometimes forced on transgender individuals in a similar fashion, was not addressed in this law.) It only applies to children under 18, and doesn\u2019t affect the rights of unlicensed private counselors. The Supreme Court has already refused to review a nearly identical California law upheld by a different appeals court.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s difficult from these two decisions to get a glimpse into the justices\u2019 thoughts on ex-gay conversion therapy. Still, I\u2019d take Monday\u2019s rejection as reason for very cautious optimism. The court often refuses to address an issue until a \u201ccircuit split\u201d emerges\u2014that is, until different appeals courts have reached different conclusions about a matter of law. But any four justices can vote to bring a case before the court, and sometimes a bloc of concerned justices will intervene absent a circuit split when they feel a lower court has gone egregiously awry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1b604235215b082e3fe"}}
