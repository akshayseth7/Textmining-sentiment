So Fonda, attempting to look like \u201ca son of a bitch,\u201d arrived on set with brown contacts over his baby blues and a ruffian\u2019s moustache atop his upper lip. Leone was displeased\u2014it was precisely the gentleness of Fonda\u2019s face that he\u2019d been planning to exploit to jarring effect. When Fonda\u2019s character killed a helpless child in one famous scene, Leone made sure to focus on those kind blue eyes.\n\nWhat azure peepers were to Fonda, jittery discomfort is to Jesse Eisenberg, who is forever twitching and glancing shoe-ward. In a review of this summer\u2019s The End of the Tour\u2014a film in which much of Eisenberg\u2019s dialogue is punctuated by nervous, joyless bursts of laughter\u2014New York Times critic A.O. Scott theorized that the actor\u2019s \u201cgenetic material is at least 25 percent weasel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFrom his callow teen jerk in The Squid and the Whale to his implacable Zuckerbot in The Social Network, there\u2019s long been a dickish undercurrent to Eisenberg\u2019s performances. One presumes he\u2019ll dust off similar moves when he plays cerebral supervillain Lex Luthor in next year\u2019s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. But in the new action-comedy movie American Ultra, Eisenberg engages in some Fonda-ish shtick-flipping\u2014a trick not unlike the one he\u2019d previously pulled in 2009\u2019s Zombieland. He makes no effort to hide his halting demeanor, but instead of snappish and guarded, here it comes off as sweet and vulnerable. Likewise, his dorky body language (all inward cant, concave chest, pigeon toes) still defines him visually. But now it\u2019s deployed as a juxtapositional joke\u2014as when Eisenberg\u2019s character, Mike, trembles and mewls after he skillfully snaps the neck of an enemy.\n\nJust as The Big Lebowski transformed the Philip Marlowe archetype into a bumbling stoner, American Ultra turns Jason Bourne into Jason Bong. When first we meet Mike, he\u2019s a small-town convenience store clerk with a prodigious pot habit. He\u2019s a mess of a guy who can\u2019t cook an omelet without setting his kitchen on fire. He\u2019s continually disappointing his devoted girlfriend (played, with orange-dyed hair and a flannel wardrobe, by Kristen Stewart) before puppyishly begging her forgiveness.\n\nThen one day, Manchurian Candidate\u2013style, Mike\u2019s hidden telos is activated when a visiting stranger recites a string of nonsense phrases. Turns out Mike was a dormant CIA sleeper agent\u2014trained in the murderous arts\u2014whose memory was wiped and replaced with a benign cover story. Now he suddenly finds himself brimming with tradecraft secrets, able to summon martial arts moves and firearms expertise. Soon, he\u2019s on the run from CIA heavies determined to neutralize their rogue asset. Can Mike escape their clutches even as he fires up yet another joint?\n\nWe initially wonder why K-Stew\u2019s character has shackled herself to this deadweight dude, as the two mope around their house listening to records and toking up (their exhalations bolstered with thick CGI clouds of smoke). But then the film posits an appealing fantasy for every woman who\u2019s felt stuck with an aimless, bumbling man: Don\u2019t worry, girl, just say the magic words and he\u2019ll magically morph into a hypercompetent superspy.\n\nAmerican Ultra is all genre send-up, with not just Eisenberg but his fellow actors playing off their established personae. Connie Britton uses her maternal vibe to become a caring but tough CIA handler. (\u201cAre you my mom?\u201d a confused but hopeful Eisenberg asks her at one point.) Topher Grace\u2019s constipated, milquetoast mien serves him well as an evil agency bureaucrat. Tony Hale, best known as Buster on Arrested Development, brings the silly to a small but funny role.\n\nThe cast is game. Stewart, in particular, gives her all, evincing genuine emotion when her on-screen boyfriend is in peril. She seems like she\u2019s in a better movie than the one on the screen\u2014one where the relationships and the stakes actually feel real.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf35e04235215b082e4be"}}
