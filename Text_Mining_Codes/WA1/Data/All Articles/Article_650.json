It\u2019s hard to see this influence feature more prominently and clearly than in the works of up and coming indie filmmakers during the 1990s, which makes perfect sense since they were the movie nerds who grew up during Scorsese\u2019s '70s reign.\n\nREAD MORE: Retrospective: The Films Of Martin Scorsese\n\nThere were two films that became a major influence on '90s cinema: \u201cDie Hard\u201d and \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d As often as 90s action fare copied the \u201cDie Hard\u201d formula (\u201cUnder Siege\u201d was \u201cDie Hard\u201d on a boat, \u201cExecutive Decision\u201d was \u201cDie Hard\u201d on a plane, etc\u2026), indie filmmakers took their cues from \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d The Hughes Brothers\u2019 \u201cMenace II Society\u201d was basically a hood version of \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d and Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s masterpiece about the '70s and '80s porn industry put a fresh new spin on Scorsese\u2019s energetic tale about a tight knit family of ruthless mobsters.\n\nOn top of the obvious \u201cGoodfellas\u201d references, PTA\u2019s breakout feature contains more than a handful of homages to Scorsese\u2019s other work. Thanks to editor and Vimeo user Jorge Luengo Ruiz\u2019s clever and detail-oriented video matching shots from \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d to their Scorsese counterparts, film buffs can further learn a lesson on how a filmmaker can assimilate the style of another filmmaker while successfully managing to make it their own.\n\nSome of the split-screen comparisons are obvious, such as the long takes in the Copacabana and the Hot Traxx nightclubs, as well as the final shot directly taken from \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d However, some of the more detailed stylistic choices that Ruiz points out in his video, such as a quick succession of close-ups to establish a scene, as well as recurrent use of whip-pans, might have escaped the scrutiny of even the most seasoned Scorsese and PTA fan like this writer proudly is. That being said, I have to admit that some of the visual parallels Ruiz attempts to point out are a bit too generic. Both Scorsese and Anderson used long shots of characters sitting around a table in a diner? What are the odds?
