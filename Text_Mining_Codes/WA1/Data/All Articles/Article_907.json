The project has been a labour of love for Mann, who has been developing it for 15 years.\n\nThe film is set to take place in 1957 and is based on the 1991 book Enzo Ferrari: The Man, The Cars, The Races, written by Brock Yates.\n\nThe script will be based on an amalgamation of two screenplays, both based on the same source.\n\nOne is from the late Troy Kennedy Martin, who wrote The Italian Job (1969), and the other is from the late David Rayfiel.\n\nSeveral female stars are reportedly being proposed for the film.\n\nFerrari was married to Laura Dominica Garello Ferrari but also had a child with his mistress Lina Lardi.\n\nIt is one of two Ferrari biopics in development, with Robert De Niro reportedly signing on for a different look at the businessman.\n\nThe actor's project comes from an Italian producer and will look at Ferrari's life from the 1940s to the 1980s.\n\nBale previously worked with Mann on the 2009 drama Public Enemies.\n\nMann's most recent film, the Chris Hemsworth cyber-thriller Blackhat, is one of the year's biggest flops, making just US$17 million (S$24 million) worldwide from a US$70-million budget.\n\nBale also experienced a domestic failure last year with Exodus: Gods And Kings, which made just US$65 million in the United States but managed to appeal to overseas audiences for a final global tally of US$268 million.\n\nTHE GUARDIAN", "_id": {"$oid": "55dc242604235215b082e4e3"}}
