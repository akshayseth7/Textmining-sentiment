The questions are multiple-choice, and time is of the essence: You have 30 seconds to answer, and as the seconds tick away, the question\u2019s point value drops from 50 all the way down to zero, so you\u2019ll want to click on your answer as fast as you possibly can. There\u2019s no penalty for an incorrect answer, so feel free to take a guess if your puny human brain fails you.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeec504235215b082e1f1"}}
