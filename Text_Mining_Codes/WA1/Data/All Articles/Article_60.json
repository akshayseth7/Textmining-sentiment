We are going to be nicer,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough, at least in my book.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was a forthright statement by Mrs. Clinton, whose advocacy work dates to the 1960s. But her confrontation with a black activist in his 30s showed how, for all her decades of effort on behalf of civil rights, there is a generational divide between those who appreciate that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and those to whom she has to prove herself all over again.\n\nThe combination of patience and gentle scolding with which she responded seemed a distillation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s worldview: that movement politics gets you only so far, and that activists must pave the way for those in office to act.\n\nAll in all, the encounter seemed to signal that racial justice will retain its potency in the Democratic primary contest \u2014 and potentially beyond, given the importance of black voters to a Democratic victory in November 2016.\n\nBut it also showed Mrs. Clinton as even her admirers lament that she is seldom seen: spontaneous, impassioned and seemingly unconcerned about potential repercussions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe exchange, taped Aug. 11, came after Black Lives Matter activists tried unsuccessfully to disrupt one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s events in Keene, N.H., as they have managed to do at campaign stops by other presidential contenders. Mrs. Clinton agreed to speak privately with the group\u2019s representatives. They have since described her remarks to reporters, but released excerpts from the video for the first time this week. The full conversation was released Wednesday.\n\nIn the video, Mrs. Clinton shows little of the soft-edged, convivial but careful persona she often displays at her staged campaign events. She is animated, serious and forceful, jabbing her finger at Mr. Jones, who is from Boston, as if she were arguing with a classmate back at Wellesley. She seems to listen intently, her hands folded in front of her. She concedes that there were unintended negative consequences from her husband\u2019s crime bill, but declines to say there was any racial undertone to that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jones seems to press Mrs. Clinton to bare her soul: \u201cNow that you understand the consequences, what in your heart has changed?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow do you actually feel that\u2019s different than you did before?\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton calls it a \u201cvery thoughtful question\u201d but demurs. \u201cThis country has still not recovered from its original sin,\u201d she says, but adds that the \u201cnext question\u201d is, \u201cSo what do you want me to do about it?\u201d\n\nShe urges Mr. Jones to help her come up with a specific \u201cvision and plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to put together,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says, \u201cin a way that I can explain it, and I can sell it \u2014 because in politics, if you can\u2019t explain it and you can\u2019t sell it, it stays on the shelf.\u201d\n\nShe shrugs off Mr. Jones\u2019s efforts to elicit a more heartfelt response.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you change hearts,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says, summarizing her basic view of social policy movements. \u201cI believe you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Mrs. Clinton pushes back, and provocatively. When Mr. Jones tells her that she is \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and that the violence he wants to counteract is a \u201cwhite problem,\u201d Mrs. Clinton retorts, \u201cRespectfully, if that is your position, then I will talk only to white people about how we are going to deal with a very real problem.\u201d\n\nFor any white Democrat, the Black Lives Matter movement poses problems, but for Mrs. Clinton, it is particularly fraught. She and her husband were stung by allegations of racism that arose in her 2008 primary contest with Barack Obama.\n\nContinue reading the main story First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cIf you watch the millennial reaction to Hillary, it\u2019s a very different reaction, because a lot of us came up during the \u201908 elections,\u201d said Elon James White, an activist and founder of the website \u201cThis Week in Blackness.\u201d \u201cThere is a very clear line in the sand.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton has the backing of many African-American leaders, including important members of the Congressional Black Caucus. But her support falls mainly on the older side of an increasingly pronounced generational divide, between long-familiar figures like the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and a newer contingent that has begun to assert itself during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe racial justice community has changed over time,\u201d said Marc H. Morial, the president of the National Urban League. He described the raw anger of the current movement as a result of a combination of several factors, including frustration at years of rhetorical head-pats from white political leaders about changing a policing and economic system that disproportionately affects African-Americans.\n\nMrs. Clinton seems cognizant of that divide. Speaking in the video with Mr. Jones, she alludes to her involvement in the civil rights movement in the \u201cold days.\u201d\n\nIndeed, she comes to the issue with a great deal of credibility among African-American advocates and politicians of a certain age for using the existing systems to bring changes. She has told of being inspired by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a high school student, when she heard him speak in Chicago, and of being drawn into working for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund by Marian Wright Edelman, her Yale law mentor. As the first lady of Arkansas, she worked to improve one the nation\u2019s poorest school systems, in which many of the students were black. As the nation\u2019s first lady, she fought for health insurance for poor children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven now, in her second presidential bid, Mrs. Clinton \u2014 often accused of being too cautious \u2014 has used some of her boldest language on issues of racial justice.\n\nMr. Morial favorably cited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech before the Urban League in July, when she talked about inequities that have lingered despite other advances. \u201cRace still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind,\u201d she said then. \u201cAnd yes, while that\u2019s partly a legacy of discrimination that stretches back to the start of our nation, it is also because of discrimination that is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nIn another speech shortly after the massacre of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, Mrs. Clinton said that racism was not merely the province of \u201ckooks and Klansmen.\u201d\n\nMinyon Moore, a longtime close friend and adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said that her credentials on race could not be questioned, and suggested that the younger cohort of activists be willing to have more of a dialogue.\n\n\u201cShe was one of the first leaders out there on race,\u201d said Ms. Moore, one of several African-American women among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s innermost circle of friends and advisers. \u201cWhat presidential candidate has asked the question, \u2018Imagine for one second if you were a black man and the police stopped you? Imagine.\u2019 If that\u2019s not in a person\u2019s heart, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nMr. Jones, in an interview on Tuesday, acknowledged having a different point of view, but he sounded a hopeful note.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a generational element to it, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a divide in that it\u2019s uncrossable,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that what\u2019s happening is Hillary Clinton\u2019s saying, \u2018We tried to change hearts, and it didn\u2019t work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn Mr. Jones\u2019s view, the way forward is \u201cactually taking a frank, honest look at the premises of bigotry and what they\u2019re tethered to in the American creed.\u201d\n\nBut judging from their videotaped meeting, Mrs. Clinton seems unlikely to be persuaded that extensive self-examination will accomplish much.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all that happens,\u201d she tells Mr. Jones in the video, with a certain world-weariness, \u201cwe\u2019ll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee4304235215b082e190"}}
