I want the creamiest vanilla, strongest coffee, richest chocolate, or most delightful green tea your freezer section has to offer. Going with tried-and-true over outrageous means I\u2019m happy down to the last melty drop at the tip of the cone.\n\nIf I do get crazy with my frozen dessert\u2014everyone slips sometimes \u2014 it\u2019s inevitably in sundae form. That's because the toppings get to happen on my terms, in controllable quantities, and once I\u2019ve eaten the cherry and waded through the peanuts layer, I\u2019m back to a bowl of basic. Such manageable risk-taking means I\u2019m not stuck with an entire serving of Peanut Butter Bacon Brownie Passion Fruit Sweet Cream.\n\nWhat follows is a recipe for my ideal summertime sundae, because it combines two warm weather favorites. S\u2019mores, even if made indoors over a stove, taste like August nights in my cousins\u2019 backyard, crowded in our still-wet swim suits around their fire pit. And strawberry ice cream is an undeniable force of seasonal perfection. Spring for the good stuff and you\u2019ll be a happy to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nStrawberry S'mores Sundae\n\nMakes 4 sundaes\n\n6 ounces semisweet chocolate\n\n1/2 cup heavy cream\n\n8 marshmallows\n\n1 pint the best strawberry ice cream you can get your hands on\n\n2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs (take out some rage on a sealed plastic bag of crackers until they reach the size you want on your ice cream; I like them somewhere between the Nerds candy and dust)\n\nSee the full recipe (and save and print it) here.\n\nPhoto by Alpha Smoot", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c804235215b082e46c"}}
