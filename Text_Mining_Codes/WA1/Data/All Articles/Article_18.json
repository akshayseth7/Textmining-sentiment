Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would be beating Hillary Clinton in the polls by now if she had opted to run for president as a champion of Wall Street reform.\n\nAt a time when nervous Democrats are eyeing 72-year-old Vice President Biden and former Vice President Al Gore \u2014 who left office 15 years ago \u2014 as potential alternatives, some liberals say it\u2019s not too late for Warren to jump in.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d be beating Hillary. That\u2019s my opinion,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, who earlier this year worked on a campaign to draft Warren to run for president.\n\n\u201cBased on the support Bernie\u2019s got and the way he\u2019s surged in the polls, that shows anything is possible,\u201d he added in reference to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has exceeded expectations by drawing big crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nClinton leads Sanders by about 20 points in national polls, but he has shown flashes of strength.\n\nA Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald survey from mid-August showed him topping her 44 percent to 37 percent in New Hampshire, the second state in the primary process.\n\nWhile Clinton has broader support within the Democratic Party, Sanders has generated more enthusiasm on the stump.\n\nNearly 2,000 supporters flocked to his event in Dubuque, Iowa, this week and more than 27,000 filled the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena earlier this month to hear him speak.\n\nClinton\u2019s largest crowd to date numbers a mere 5,500, according to The Washington Post. The overflow area her campaign set up for a June 13 launch event on Roosevelt Island wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nAs much as Sanders has surprised the pundits, some Democrats think Warren would have run an even stronger campaign against Clinton because of her name recognition and reputation as a committed Wall Street reformer.\n\nClinton could generate more enthusiasm by embracing some of the financial regulatory reforms long championed by Warren, Democrats say.\n\nChris Shelton, the newly elected president of the Communications Workers of America, said cracking down on Wall Street\u2019s excesses are a top priority for his union\u2019s members.\n\n\u201cMy members and the general public believe that it\u2019s time we got some economic justice in this country. The ultra, ultra rich are running things,\u201d he said. \u201cMy members and the public think it\u2019s time Wall Street stops controlling Main Street and Main Street has a shot to get this country moving again.\u201d\n\nShelton said he would love it if Warren gave a second though to running for president.\n\n\u201cHave you heard that Elizabeth Warren is going to change her mind? I\u2019d be real interested if she did,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Elizabeth Warren. I think she\u2019d do well,\u201d he added, though he declined to speculate whether she\u2019d be leading the polls now had she jumped in.\n\nDemocrats say Clinton has some trouble generating excitement because she\u2019s been on the national political stage for more than two decades, first as first lady, then as New York\u2019s junior senator and President Obama\u2019s secretary of State.\n\n\u201cHillary is a consummate insider and has been now for more for almost a quarter of a century or so. People are more excited by someone who takes no big money and can show that he\u2019s the real deal and is independent,\u201d Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign For America\u2019s Future, said of Sanders. \u201cThat excites people a lot and they want to be part of building the movement he will build.\u201d\n\nSome liberals believe Warren would have matched or even exceeded Bernie\u2019s success in drawing crowds and building excitement.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d be doing as well or better than Bernie,\u201d Borosage said, adding that it\u2019s not too late for Warren to change her mind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late but I don\u2019t think she will. You can get in pretty late in the modern world because you can raise so much money so quickly with so little effort over the web,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Hillary collapsed in Iowa or New Hampshire, somebody could get in and make a difference.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s poll numbers have sagged in recent weeks amidst a barrage of Republican criticism over her use of a private email server while at the State Department. She has pushed back by arguing she did not send or receive classified documents. The FBI is attempting to recover deleted material from the server to find out whether she violated government policy.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from early August showed Clinton\u2019s positive rating had dropped to 37 percent from 44 percent in June.\n\nLiberals, however, say they are more concerned about Clinton\u2019s stance on the issues, especially on the question of reining in Wall Street and stopping what they call the \u201crevolving door\u201d of corporate lobbyists and advisors who shuttle between government and the private sector.\n\nMany say they will judge her campaign based on how it lives up the benchmarks set by Warren, who is beloved on the left. They want her to back expanding Social Security benefits, endorse reestablishing the barrier between risky investment banking and ordinary commercial banking, and vow to keep former lobbyists and Wall Street veterans out of her administration.\n\nIf Warren had run for president, she would have put Clinton on her heels, liberals say.\n\n\u201cThe enthusiasm, the energy that Warren tapped into would have made her an incredibly strong contender. She obviously decided not to get in the race but there\u2019s no doubt that her agenda is exactly where the primary electorate is,\u201d said Ilya Sheyman, the executive director of MoveOn.org, which helped launch the \u201cRun Warren Run\u201d campaign.\n\nSheyman argues the race is still wide open and is pushing Clinton to embrace, as has Warren, a proposal to expand Social Security. Her campaign rivals, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, have already done so.\n\n\u201cProgressives are incredibly eager to hear if Secretary Clinton will come out for expanding Social Security. At this point it\u2019s a wide open race and we\u2019re looking forward to vigorous conversations,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not all Democrats agree that Warren would have given Clinton a viable challenge. Some say she would struggle, like Sanders has, in appealing to African-American and Latino voters.\n\nJoe Trippi, a strategist who served as campaign manager of Howard Dean\u2019s insurgent liberal bid in 2004, downplayed Clinton\u2019s vulnerability.\n\n\u201cIf she were threatened and her supporters thought, \u2018Hillary is in trouble,\u2019 there would be more energy in her campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people don\u2019t see Bernie Sanders as a threat yet.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in Democratic presidential primaries going back to 1984, African Americans have been a key demographic, and argued that Clinton has those voters in her camp at this point. He said a potential game changer would be if Obama endorsed Sanders, but virtually no one in Washington expects that to happen.\n\n\u201cThe easiest thing on the planet is for the most progressive person in the race to get to 25 or 30 [percent,]\u201d Trippi said.\n\n\u201cAmong a bunch of white candidates, the one who wins the Democratic nomination is anyone who dominates among minority voters,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is where Clinton\u2019s long history on the national stage comes in handy. She has developed strong relationships with many of the so-called political gatekeepers of the black and Hispanic communities. She also benefits from being married to Bill Clinton, who used to be called the nation\u2019s first black president because of his appeal to African Americans.\n\nRead more from The Hill:\n\nBiden holds meeting with Elizabeth Warren", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee1304235215b082e16a"}}
