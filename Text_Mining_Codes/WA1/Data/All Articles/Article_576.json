Describing the shift as a \u201csemiotic land grab,\u201d Slate\u2019s Lowen Liu lamented, \u201c[T]he name we use for the building blocks of our language has now been partially co-opted.\u201d Those of us who were persuaded by Liu\u2019s claims were helpless at first. Google, we thought, was too large, too powerful: Alphabet was theirs, even though it was the worst name imaginable.\n\nBut now Slate has found a way to fight back, and we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll join our resistance. Our new Chrome extension \u201cAlphabet to Google\u201d transforms every appearance of the word Alphabet back to Google. In the spirit of \u201cMillennials to Snake People,\u201d it may make your experience of the Web a little more surreal, not least of all because it makes no distinction between correct and incorrect uses of the word. Consider this our symbolic revenge on alphabet-obsessed Sesame Street for decamping from public television to the alphabetically named HBO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cAlphabet to Google\u201d also has the added benefit of turning articles about the name change itself into something far more Dadaist. Liu describes \u201cGoogle\u2019s transubstantiation into Google\u201d as \u201ca bully move\u201d; meanwhile, Will Oremus\u2019 post on the name change becomes richly redundant, as much a postmodern tone poem as a news item: \u201cSeemingly out of the blue on Monday,\u201d he writes, \u201cGoogle announced that it is forming a new company, called Google. Google won\u2019t be part of Google. Rather, Google will become part of Google. Are you confused yet?\u201d\n\nInstall it, won\u2019t you? If nothing else, it\u2019ll make this article pretty weird.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf10904235215b082e397"}}
