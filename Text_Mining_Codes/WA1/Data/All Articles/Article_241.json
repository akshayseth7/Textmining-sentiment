Just like every item of clothing, how you wear your hat goes in and out of style. Flatbrims and snap-backs, which used to be cool, are now cool again. When you embrace the classic look, the cool factor comes back.\n\nWell, the same could be said for Harris English. The big-hitting Georgian, who finished his first round at the Memorial on Thursday tied for the lead, is throwing it back old-school a bit with his hat selection.\n\nView image | gettyimages.com\n\nHere's a look at classic Trevino, rocking the rope hat like a BOSS.\n\nView image | gettyimages.com\n\nAnd there are even some old-school rope hats out there, if you're interested in rocking one like Harris is.\n\nAnd old-school Ping one was auctioned off on eBay a few years ago.\n\nPinterest vintage-ping-hat.jpg\n\nRelated: The best and the worst in style this week\n\nWe also found a bunch on Etsy -- all throwback country club ones.
