That evening, though, the Texas firebrand will be on stage a few miles down the road preaching to his own choir.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nCruz will be hosting what he has dubbed the \u201cRally for Religious Liberty,\u201d a campaign event that is expected to draw thousands of Iowans to a Des Moines venue not far from the state\u2019s iconic fairgrounds. The Cruz- and Christian-themed festivities will be headlined by the Newsboys, a Christian pop rock band with remarkable staying power, and will feature, in the words and capitalization of Cruz\u2019s website, \u201cSPECIAL GUESTS VICTIMIZED BY GOVERNMENT PERSECUTION.\u201d Bring the kids!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWho exactly are these Americans who have seen their First Amendment rights trampled under the boot of Big Government? Here's a quick rundown of the conservative causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bre that Cruz plans to bring out on stage in the name of religious liberty\u2014and his quest to win over the Iowa Evangelicals who will help decide their state\u2019s first-in-the-nation GOP nominating contest:\n\nDick and Betty Odgaard : A Mennonite couple who was fined $5,000 by the Iowa Civil Rights Commission late last year for refusing to provide service to a gay couple who wanted to get married in their wedding venue, a former church that the Odgaards had converted into a for-profit art gallery, flower shop, and bistro. Rather than open their doors to gays and lesbians for future ceremonies, the Odgaards announced they\u2019d stop holding weddings of any kind earlier this year and ultimately closed their venue last month.\n\n\n\n: A Mennonite couple who was fined $5,000 by the Iowa Civil Rights Commission late last year for refusing to provide service to a gay couple who wanted to get married in their wedding venue, a former church that the Odgaards had converted into a for-profit art gallery, flower shop, and bistro.

Kelvin Cochran: A former Atlanta fire chief who was forced to step down earlier this year by the city\u2019s mayor after Cochran self-published a book that described homosexuality as a \u201csexual perversion\u201d that he compared to bestiality, copies of which he had distributed to several city employees. Mayor Kasim Reed maintains that his decision to terminate Cochran wasn\u2019t based on the fire chief\u2019s religious beliefs but instead on a variety of other reasons, including that he didn\u2019t have clearance from City Hall to publish the book in the first place.\n\nUnlike some of his more establishment-minded GOP rivals who appear content to leave their party\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage in the past, Cruz has repeatedly attempted to bring it front and center on the stump, increasingly under the guise of what he and his like-minded social conservatives have labeled \u201creligious liberty,\u201d a catchall they\u2019ve deployed in rather wide-ranging circumstances.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1a304235215b082e3ec"}}
