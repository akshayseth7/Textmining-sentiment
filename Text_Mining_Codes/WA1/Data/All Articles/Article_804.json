From its extended opening shot, which winds its way into and around a nightclub, it brings to mind Goodfellas and its famous long take winding through the Copacabana. Similarly, its last shot, which shows the main character giving himself an extended pep talk in the mirror, is a clear homage to Raging Bull.\n\n\n\nBut this new video essay from Jorge Luengo Ruiz (via Indiewire) shows just how deep the Scorsese influence goes. In between those opening and closing shots, there are the whip pans, the rapid-fire close-ups of flashbulbs, the iris shots, and the emphatic camera moves that push in on a character right as he snorts a line of cocaine, before panning up to show his reaction.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf30604235215b082e47b"}}
