However @Morehouse does not grant admissions or scholarships based on race. \u2014 Morehouse College (@Morehouse) August 19, 2015\n\nIndeed, King credits the Morehouse/Oprah Winfrey scholarship as the reason he has a college degree. \u201cOprah Winfrey paid my way through Morehouse. The leadership scholarship that I received from her is why I have a college degree today. Five hundred other brothers have the exact same story,\u201d King wrote in his Daily Kos diary.\n\nOprah Winfrey has yet to respond to emails asking for response.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daefdc04235215b082e275"}}
