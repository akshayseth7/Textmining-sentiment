Nevertheless, Vicious, which premieres on PBS on Sunday, is just that. It stars Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi as a gay couple in their 70s who have been together for nearly 50 years. Their social routine\u2014which largely consists of barbed interactions with their old friends Violet, Mason, and Penelope\u2014is interrupted when Ash, a new upstairs neighbor played by Iwan Rheon (Game of Thrones\u2019 Ramsay Snow), knocks on their door.\n\nSlate spoke with Janetti about working with some of Britain\u2019s finest actors, the U.K. press\u2019s reaction to the show, and femme-phobia.\n\nHow did an American writer come to make such a British show?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMark Ravenhill, the British playwright, had an idea for doing a show about two elderly gay men, but he was unable to do it because of his commitments at the RSC. I liked the idea of Ian McKellen and Derek Jacob as a gay couple that had been together for 50 years, so I created the world from that starting place. We got commissioned by [British network] ITV, and we took it from there.\n\nHow much involvement did McKellen and Jacobi have in shaping the show?\n\nIn the very earliest stages, we talked a lot about these men and what\u2019s really going on underneath. It always had to be a real truth and a real love underneath, a real history. It had to be rooted in something so they could be horrible to each other and behave in this way. We talked about the 50 years they spent together. How they met. What their flat is like. What their relationship is like with their friends. Nothing in it wasn\u2019t very thought-out. Then once everybody was very clear on the universe, they were willing to just go with it.\n\nThis is a very gay show, not only because of the subject matter, but the astonishing assemblage of out gay talent\u2014you, Mark Ravenhill, the stars, you even have Jimmy Somerville singing the theme tune.\n\nIt is, and in the U.K. it\u2019s on ITV, which is a very mainstream network. They\u2019d never done a gay show before. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a U.K. sitcom with gay leads, certainly that were a romantic couple.\n\nAnd yet some U.K. critics\u2014mostly straight critics\u2014said that it trafficked in outdated stereotypes. How did you respond to that?\n\nIt was a little troubling, to be honest. All the initial reviews of the show were extraordinarily positive and wonderful, then once the show premiered, there was a bit of a backlash. It\u2019s a complicated issue, but I find it very interesting that a lot of the straight press called it so stereotypical, as if they\u2019d been our champions for so long and are so worried about safeguarding how we\u2019re represented, which we know isn\u2019t the case. I believe that it\u2019s a way to be able to dismiss something in a way that you can get away with. Clearly, there are stereotypes about being gay that are funny, that we celebrate\u2014in comedy, that\u2019s what you do. But where else has there been a show where you see a couple that love each other, that have been together for 50 years, that are out gay men, played by two out gay men.\n\nThese would\u2019ve been pioneers\u2014that means that they\u2019ve been out and never lived a lie since the mid-\u201960s. That\u2019s extraordinary. It was very easy to dismiss them as stereotypes, and say it\u2019s camp, as if that has a negative connotation. This is part of our history. And also they\u2019re very smart, wicked, loving men.\n\nThere was another criticism: that Derek Jacobi\u2019s character isn\u2019t out to his mother. Well, the joke is that he\u2019s in his 70s, his mother is in her 90s. The joke is that his mother\u2019s still alive, and he\u2019s been dealing with this for 48 years. People of their generation didn\u2019t come out, so it becomes a very touching thing. If I was writing a show about a 30-year-old man or woman, I would never make that the subject, because it\u2019s been done to death, and we\u2019ve moved past that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re dealing with gay shows, there are so few of them, and people place so many expectations of what they need it to be. And the fact that this had a little bit of subversiveness to it and was a little bit politically incorrect, and it was featuring Ian and Derek, it had to bear extra weight.\n\nPerhaps more unusual than a show about gay people is to have a show about old people.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I felt, too. There are six characters in the show, and five of them are in their late 60s or 70s. That never happens. And they\u2019re vital. They\u2019re not the sidebar to somebody else. They\u2019re not the adjunct. The young man is the one who\u2019s trying to be in their world.\n\nSo those accusations about dated stereotypes might reflect people not knowing older gay men.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I would have had the courage to come out in the way they would have had to do. What they had to deal with in the \u201960s is why I can be where I am now. It\u2019s so easy to say the men of that generation are too camp. What men of that generation had to go through when they were in their 20s, to swim against the tide, to not get married, to not pretend you have a girlfriend. Being gay was against the law; you could have gone to jail. These aren\u2019t things we discuss, because it\u2019s a sitcom, but it\u2019s implicit.\n\nI was very interested in the character of Violet, played by Frances de la Tour, again one of the great actors of her generation. She\u2019s playing a role that\u2019s very similar to her character on the British sitcom Rising Damp from the 1970s; there are almost predatory elements in the way she comes on to Iwan Rheon\u2019s character, Ash. Tell me how you see Violet.\n\nWhat I love about Violet is that this is a woman who\u2019s in her 60s, who\u2019s never been married, who doesn\u2019t have children, who\u2019s worked for herself, and who\u2019s lived her own life. She\u2019s teasing Ash because she can, and she\u2019s getting a rise out of him. She\u2019s enjoying herself. The way Frances does it, there\u2019s a wink to what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s on a line, but the intention is never for it to be anything lurid. She\u2019s playing with him and she\u2019s having fun with her sexuality. She\u2019s happy. She\u2019s indefatigable. She has had horrific relationships, but she\u2019s positive about them all. I told Frances that Violet would never use a negative word. She never says something\u2019s terrible. She says, \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t wonderful.\u201d We don\u2019t see women like these celebrated. There\u2019s a certain negativity to the boys, especially Freddie, who looks at everything through a very negative prism. But everything is an opportunity, an adventure, to her.\n\nEven in these enlightened times, people still seem to have a problem with effeminate or camp gay characters. It\u2019s OK to be butch, but a character who\u2019s a bit queeny isn\u2019t so well-received. It was the same with Jack on Will & Grace.\n\nYes, it did happen on Will & Grace. There had never been a show that was a mainstream hit before that was told from the point of view of gay men. Jack was a three-dimensional, specific character\u2014there was something very weird and layered and unusual. And there were elements in there that I have. We grew up having to tamp down certain things. I spent so many years when I couldn\u2019t gesture too much because of how it seemed, having to conform. So, yes, there are some camp elements to them, but there\u2019s no mincing, there\u2019s a dignity.\n\nWe need to respect the mincing. It\u2019s part of our culture!\n\nAlso, it\u2019s funny! When you\u2019re doing a comedy, you want to make it funny.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2c104235215b082e466"}}
