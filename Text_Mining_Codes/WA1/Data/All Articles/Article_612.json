Maybe it\u2019s because you have to go back to school. Maybe it\u2019s because your only vacation left to look forward to is Thanksgiving at your uncle\u2019s house. Maybe it\u2019s because the ground below you is literally sinking, because all the groundwater is being sucked out to feed drought-struck ag land.\n\nIf your sinking feeling is non-metaphorical, then you probably live in California\u2019s Central Valley. After four years without rain, the farmers in the state\u2019s agricultural belly have been drilling more and more water out of the groundwater aquifers, which have become so drained that they are causing the land above to subside. A new analysis shows that in some places, that rate of sinking is close to two inches per month.\n\nThese here maps come from radar observations\u2014collected over two periods by Japanese and Canadian orbiters\u2014which were prepared and analyzed by a team of researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for California\u2019s Department of Water Resources.\n\nThe data show three big subsidence areas. The largest is centered just southeast of a small farming town called Corcoran (home of the state prison that is home to Charles Manson!). The subsidence bowl here\u2014sinking at a rate of 1.6 inches per month\u2014roughly overlays an area that use to be Lake Tulare, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi before it was drained by farmers in the early 20th century.\n\nNot to pile on the irony, but subsidence is also putting the state\u2019s above ground water delivery system in danger. The California Aqueduct\u2014a big, artificial concrete river\u2014connects the Sacramento River Delta to Los Angeles, passing through (and irrigating) a lot of farmland along the way. To keep the water flowing north to south, the river is built on a slight grade. Subsidence, no shock, is bad for the aqueduct. In their report, the California DWR put it this way:\n\nRoads can be broken by fissures, pipelines have been exhumed, and the slope of the land can be altered, changing drainage patterns. This last effect has proven to be a significant problem on the California Aqueduct, where the canal lining has been raised in multiple locations over the years in order to preserve flow.\n\nThe report shows other major subsidence bowls, one centered about 100 miles north of the Corcoran zone, and another north of Sacramento. When you suck water, the land sinks. And when the land sinks, it really sucks.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf15a04235215b082e3ba"}}
