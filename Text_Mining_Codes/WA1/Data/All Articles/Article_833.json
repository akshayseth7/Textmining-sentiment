Also one of the alias names, \u201cninabway,\u201d has also been used to promote the Kickstarter project on Reddit.\n\nThe screen shot revealed the following:\n\nThis information appeared just a few days after an intense interview with Milliken and Yelp\u2019s VP of Corporate Communications, Shannon Eis, on CNBC\u2019s Fast Money. During the show, the ladies clashed about the film\u2019s information, including which studies are being used.\n\nEis stated:\n\n\u201cWe are not here out of fear, we are here out of facts. Making sure that they transcend this conversation. Dismissing the FTC, dismissing five federal judges who all found no wrongdoing and dismissing an exhaustive Harvard Business School study and not the one that she is citing. That is a different one that looks specifically at our recommendation software and draws no connections to advertising. So, she\u2019s citing an older, not Yelp specifically study. \u201cThough dismissing all that seems to be weird, when all of it has very exhaust fully debunk the claims. But why we\u2019re here is because it is important that the facts speak and that the valued consumers that we want to create and continue to drive really transcends with us.\u201d\n\nMilliken responded with:\n\n\u201cI did use Yelp to look up businesses, to see if there were places I wanted to go to or not, and I went to my physicians one day and she began to tell me about her experiences with Yelp and I was floored by the things she told me. And I went home and began to investigate it and the more I dug, the more I found and I thought that this was a story that should be told because I didn\u2019t know about any of things that were going on with Yelp and I asked my friends if they knew and they weren\u2019t aware of these allegations against Yelp either. And I thought that this story should be told and I can offer a platform to do that. \u201cI\u2019m not dismissing what [FTC] said, I am going to touch extensively on that in the documentary and I will let the experts speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nNoting that Milliken has had conflict with the website before, Ein added:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here today because she is raising money on Kickstarter to fund her film. So we\u2019re all apart of a fundraising effort today. But I think what is important to state is that we did discover through the recommended software that is largely being contested here that Ms. Milliken herself had created three sock puppet accounts to create false five star ratings of her husband\u2019s law firm. Her husband, who is also listed as the CFO for this production that she\u2019s fundraising for, as a result of this media. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s important to say that the accusations that she\u2019s making she has actually been apart of on the back end of the software process that we are talking about that helps protect consumers and present true and authentic reviews was something that triggered finding her false reviews on the site and suppressed them.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to show that Yelp doesn\u2019t scare them at all, Milliken and her team announced:\n\n\u201cA few hours prior to the interview, Kaylie had a pre-interview with a producer at CNBC, and at the end of the call, Kaylie was told that someone from Yelp would be on the show as well (the VP of their communications department, Shannon Eis.) Was Kaylie nervous? Absolutely. Did she step up to the challenge? Without a doubt! \u201cThere were points that Ms. Eis brought up that were flat out wrong. We are excited to release our documentary, as all her statements \u2013 including many misrepresentations \u2013 will be addressed. Thank you all for the continued support you show! We love hearing from you, so please continue to leave comments and share your stories.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf32e04235215b082e499"}}
