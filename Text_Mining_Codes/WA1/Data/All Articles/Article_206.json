Today, the company released a statement in which CEO Daniel Ek clarified how exactly the privacy permissions would be used.\n\n\u201cLet me be crystal clear here: If you don\u2019t want to share this kind of information, you don\u2019t have to. We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data \u2013 and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these will enable opt-in experiences, something that Spotify regrettably neglected to mention when it first announced the changes. The app won\u2019t go scanning for your photos, but it\u2019s reserving the right to access them if and when you want it to.\n\nThe privacy settings don\u2019t seem quite so creepy in that light. Even more helpful? Putting what Spotify is asking for in the context of its contemporaries.\n\nWe read through the Android app privacy policies of Pandora, Rdio, Tidal, Google Play Music, and Beats Music (soon to be Apple Music) to see which of the Spotify permissions that have rankled people show up there as well. As it turns out, most streaming-music apps ask for similar things, and often for good reason.\n\nMost of the concern centers around three categories: the collection of locally stored contacts, photos, or media files; location and sensor data; and sharing information with third parties. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on below.\n\nContacts, photos, media files: Yes. Pandora also has permission to \u201cadd or modify calendar events and send email to guests without owners\u2019 knowledge.\u201d\n\nLocation: Yes: \u201cWe may collect and use approximated or realtime location information, such as GPS location, from devices you use to access the Pandora Service.\u201d\n\nThird parties: Yes. \u201cWe may receive or collect information about you from third parties, and combine and store it on our servers with other information we may have already received or collected from you.\u201d\n\nContacts, photos, media files: No on contacts, yes to photos/media/files. Rdio also has permission to \u201cread sensitive log data.\u201d\n\nLocation: Not listed.\n\nThird parties: Yes. \u201cWe will not sell or rent your email address or any of your Personal Information. However, to operate the Rdio Service, we may share your information in the following ways: [7 sub categories, plus \u201cthird party analytics tools.\u201d]\n\nBeats Music (Apple Music)\n\nContacts, photos, media files: No on contacts, yes to photos/media/files.\n\nLocation: Yes. \u201cWe collect your location-based information for the purpose of developing, delivering, and improving our Service for you.\u201d\n\nThird parties: Yes. \u201cExcept as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Beats Music will not disclose Personal Information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: [4 situations in which they will]\u201c\n\nContacts, photos, media files: No on contacts, yes to photos/media/files.\n\nLocation: Yes. \u201cWhen you use the Service, we store information generated by your use of the Service, such as\u2026 time of log-in, location of sessions if allowed by the device, what version of the Service you use, technical data such as your IP address, location information, and other similar information.\u201d\n\nThird parties: Yes. \u201cWe will not share your personal data with third parties except in the following situations: [4 situations in which they will]\u201d\n\nGoogle Play Music\n\nGoogle Play Music is covered by Google\u2019s blanket privacy policy, which, I mean, if you\u2019re on an Android phone Google knows everything about you.\n\nBut Why? And What Can You Do?\n\nSo most music-streaming services ask for similar information, some of which sounds pretty invasive. It\u2019s worth taking a step back, though, and considering both why those permissions exist, and what you can do to get around them.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down a little further, since these are big categories that contain a few different implications.\n\nContacts: If you think of or use a streaming-music app as literally just a collection of playlists, you\u2019re right to be annoyed that it wants access to your address book. Increasingly, though, apps like Spotify think of themselves as mini social networks, a way to share artists and songs among friends. Currently, Spotify taps into your social media profiles (if you let it) to help enable those connections. Access to your contacts would let you find friends on Spotify through their email addresses or phone numbers, exactly how Instagram, Twitter, or any other social network currently does.\n\nPhotos: It\u2019s uncomfortable to think of a music app combing through your photo library, but think again of the social element. As Spotify CEO Daniel Ek pointed out on Twitter last night, access to your photos would be a convenient way for the app to let you customize header art on a playlist, or upload a new profile picture. Though it wasn\u2019t clear in the first wording of its privacy update, Spotify has now said it will ask you for permission to access your photos when and if you want to upload a photo.\n\nMedia files: Many music streaming apps let you download playlists to your phone to listen to those songs offline. Those songs are stored as media files, which the apps then need permission to read.\n\nLocation: Spotify recently introduced a feature that generates a playlist to match your running pace; for that to work, it needs to know where you are and how fast you\u2019re moving.\n\nBeyond that, though, Spotify has been very public about its desire to provide context-aware playlists and songs. As we reported in July:\n\n\u201cSpotify is beginning to read your context\u2014your location, the time of day, and more\u2014to make deeply educated guesses about what you might want to listen to. You always run at 7 am, before work; Spotify\u2019s going to start showing you running playlists at 7 am.\u201d\n\nTo some of you, that may sound creepy. If so, you are probably right to leave Spotify for something less invasive. That\u2019s also, though, the inherent trade-off for playlists that can (very well, anecdotally) anticipate your needs based on where you are and when.\n\nThird parties: This is the arguably gross part, but it\u2019s also not new or unique. Advertising is a part of staying in business, and Spotify shares data (which it says is \u201cde-identified,\u201d as opposed to specific personal information) with \u201cpartners who help [them] with marketing and advertising efforts.\u201d Besides which, all apps need to allow at least some form of third-party communication in cases of legal liability. This is about as standard as it gets.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no way for Spotify to fine-tune the permissions language that Android uses to show users what an app wants and needs to access. That, combined with too-vague description of the new policy, landed the company in some hot water. Today\u2019s statement goes a long way to ease those concerns.\n\nThere\u2019s an even better solution on the horizon, though. Starting in Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), which will be released later this fall to select devices and eventually trickle its way down throughout the Android ecosystem, you\u2019ll be able to allow specific permissions within every app you use. Don\u2019t want Rdio to access your calendar? You can block it, but allow everything else. It\u2019s a much more user-friendly way to manage access to your phone, at least until you realize just how important some of permissions are to basic features and functions.\n\nSpotify\u2019s not perfect, and it could do well to not reach so deeply into your privacy cookie jar (and to be clearer about why it wants to in the first place). Before you cancel your subscription, though, it\u2019s important to understand two things. First, for better or worse it\u2019s using this intel to help build a better product. Second, you\u2019re going to be giving away basically the same access anywhere where you turn.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef0304235215b082e224"}}
