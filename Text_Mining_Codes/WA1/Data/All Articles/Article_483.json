In the case of Borges, Wallace argued, \u201cthe stories so completely transcend their motive cause that the biographical facts become, in the deepest and most literal way, irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThe same can be said of Wallace himself, and, for that matter, of just about any author worth reading. The work is everything; the life is trivia. And since I\u2019m about to praise a movie about David Foster Wallace that claims fidelity to at least some of the facts of his life, I should perhaps identify myself as a devoted nonconsumer of literary biographies, an avowed biopic skeptic and, unless someone offers me a lot of money to write one, a habitual avoider of celebrity profiles. So by all rights I should hate \u201cThe End of the Tour,\u201d James Ponsoldt\u2019s new film, a portrait of the writer that has its origins in a (never-published) magazine profile. In fact, I love it.\n\nContinue reading the main story Video\n\nSome of the people closest to Wallace, who committed suicide in 2008, have condemned the movie sight unseen, and friends of his who did see it (one of them also a friend of mine) have found fault with both its details and its overall design. As an ardent, ambivalent reader of Wallace\u2019s prose and a complete stranger to him personally, I can only respect such objections. But the movie, in my view, disarms them \u2014 not because it offers an especially loving or lifelike picture of its subject but rather because David Foster Wallace is not really its subject at all. \u201cThe End of the Tour\u201d is at once an exercise in post-postmodern literary mythmaking and an unsparing demolition of the contemporary mythology of the writer. It\u2019s ultimately a movie \u2014 one of the most rigorous and thoughtful I\u2019ve seen \u2014 about the ethical and existential traps our fame-crazed culture sets for the talented and the mediocre alike.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are two Davids in the movie, which takes place in 1996. Both of them are writers. One is Wallace (Jason Segel), whose third book of fiction, the 1,079-page dystopian tennis-rehab epic \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d has just been published to hyperbolic acclaim. The other is David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg), whose own recently released novel, \u201cThe Art Fair,\u201d has met with polite indifference. An early scene finds him on his couch reading \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d while his girlfriend, Sarah (Anna Chlumsky), is curled up with the season\u2019s other fictional blockbuster, the anonymously published political roman \u00e0 clef \u201cPrimary Colors.\u201d (Oh, the \u201990s. Sorry you missed all the fun, kids. Kind of sorry I didn\u2019t.)\n\nDavid L., a new, probationary hire at Rolling Stone magazine, convinces his skeptical editor (Ron Livingston) that David F.W. is worthy of a feature article, and so finds himself in Bloomington, Ill., in the middle of winter. (Wallace taught for many years at Illinois State University.) The plan is that the reporter will accompany the novelist to Minneapolis, the last stop on his book tour. He does, and that\u2019s pretty much the plot of the movie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ponsoldt, whose earlier features include \u201cThe Spectacular Now\u201d and \u201cSmashed,\u201d would much rather observe two people in aimless conversation than usher them through the tollbooths of narrative convention. And conversation, including the uncomfortable silences that punctuate it, is pretty much the entire substance of \u201cThe End of the Tour.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s a fair amount of smoking and junk-food eating, an excursion to the Mall of America and a multiplex showing of \u201cBroken Arrow\u201d (with John Travolta taking a missile to the gut), but Mr. Ponsoldt and the screenwriter, the playwright Donald Margulies, allow words to speak louder than actions.\n\nMany of the words are Wallace\u2019s own, uttered into Mr. Lipsky\u2019s tape recorder in 1996 and transcribed, 14 years later, for publication in a book called \u201cAlthough of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself.\u201d Funny, intriguing and revealing as this talk may be, it does not have anything like the status of Wallace\u2019s writing. The film not only acknowledges this distinction, but it also insists on it. In his would-be profiler\u2019s company, occasionally glancing at the menacing red light of the predigital tape recorder, Wallace is by turns cagey and candid, witty and earnest, but he is always aware, at times painfully, that he is playing the role of a writer in someone else\u2019s fantasy. Actually writing is something he does when no one else is around.\n\nContinue reading the main story Video\n\nMr. Segel\u2019s performance, whether it captures the true Wallace or not, is sharp and sensitive, in no small part because it\u2019s modest and appropriately evasive. The essential David Wallace is precisely what the film reminds us we can\u2019t see, even as David Lipsky wants desperately to track him down and display him to the readers of Rolling Stone. Wallace is caught in a familiar set of contradictions. He wants attention but craves solitude. He\u2019s willing to collaborate with the machinery of publicity even as he worries about the phoniness of it all. He\u2019s ambitious and eager to protect himself from the consequences of his ambition. In short, he\u2019s a famous writer.\n\nAs such he is, for his short-term companion, both alpha dog and prey, an object of envy as well as admiration, a meal ticket and an imaginary friend. The film poses the question \u201cWho is the real David Foster Wallace?\u201d as a feint. He is its premise, its axiom, its great white whale. The more relevant question, the moral problem on which the movie turns, is \u201cwho is David Lipsky?\u201d\n\nIn real life, David Lipsky might be a great guy, but on screen he is played by Mr. Eisenberg, which means that his genetic material is at least 25 percent weasel. Wallace at one point playfully describes himself as \u201cpleasantly unpleasant.\u201d Lipsky is unpleasantly pleasant, which is much worse. Twitchy and ingratiating, he wants to be a tough journalist and a pal. He desperately wants Wallace to regard him as a peer and can hardly contain his jealousy. He berates Sarah after she chats with Wallace on the phone and falls into a defensive snit after Wallace accuses him of flirting with Betsy (Mickey Sumner), a poet who had known Wallace in graduate school.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis awfulness is, to some degree, structural. A profile writer, especially in the company of another writer, is a false friend who dreams of being a secret sharer. Lipsky\u2019s assignment is to pry, distort and betray, to use Wallace\u2019s words and the details of his existence as material for his own dubious project. Wallace knows this and acquiesces to it \u2014 \u201cyou agreed to the interview\u201d is Lipsky\u2019s fallback when his subject gets prickly \u2014 and generally handles himself with grace and forbearance.\n\nYou may find yourself wishing that he didn\u2019t have to, which is to say wishing that \u201cThe End of the Tour\u201d didn\u2019t exist even as you hang on its every word and revel in its rough, vernacular beauty. In an ideal world, we would all sit at home reading \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d and then go out to eat hamburgers, argue about philosophy and watch cheesy action blockbusters. There would be no pseudo-authoritative biographies or prying, preening magazine profiles to complicate our pleasures, and ambitious actors would not dare to impersonate beloved novelists. But the world we live in is plagued by all of those things. There will always be films about writers and writing, and this one is just about as good as it gets.\n\n\u201cThe End of the Tour\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
