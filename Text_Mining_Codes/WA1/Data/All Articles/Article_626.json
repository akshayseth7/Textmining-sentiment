Olivia burbles on about love, but Elle pays her no mind. \u201cLeave your keys on the coffee table,\u201d she tells the younger woman, cold as ice. Then she heads to the shower where she dissolves into tears.\n\nJune Thomas June Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward, Slate\u2019s LGBTQ section.\n\nA little later, as Elle conjures happier memories by flipping through old photos and perfectly preserved children\u2019s artwork, she receives an unexpected visitor: It\u2019s her teenage granddaughter, Sage (Julia Garner), who\u2019s pregnant, has an appointment to get an abortion in just under nine hours, and needs $600 to pay for it. Since Elle, a poet and occasional academic writer-in-residence, has just $43 to her name and has made a charming, if unmelodic, wind chime from her chopped-up credit cards, there\u2019s only one possible course of action: The two of them whip the cover off Vi\u2019s amazing old Dodge and hit the road, hoping to find a friend who\u2019ll lend them the cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat what follows is transparently a string of guest-star vignettes doesn\u2019t make the road trip any less enjoyable to watch. What could have been an abbreviated version of 24, with Tomlin in the Jack Bauer role, turns into something far less frantic. There\u2019s no countdown clock on the screen as Elle and Sage ride around Los Angeles. Instead, it\u2019s a gentle journey of enlightenment, as Sage gets to see Elle at her worst\u2014when she childishly acts out in a pretentious coffee shop\u2014and at her best, when she stands up to dopey young guys and lovesick old men in order to safeguard Sage\u2019s future. Garner, memorable as the lonely high-schooler whose openness to seduction freaked out Matthew Rhys\u2019 Philip Jennings on The Americans, is curious and observant, keen to know more about her grandmother than crazy, angry, misanthropic\u2014the simplistic adjectives her mother uses to describe her.\n\nFrom the kid who knocked up Sage, who is objectively an impudent waste of DNA, Elle swipes a few bucks and some choice weed; from tattoo artist Deathy (Laverne Cox as a tatted-up Bettie Page type), she receives a small monetary contribution and some fresh ink.* A visit to a lesbian-run caf\u00e9\u2014where, true to life, the employees\u2019 interpersonal drama is far more interesting than the food\u2014provides a reminder that, although she claims to have a plan to raise the money, Elle has a poet\u2019s impracticality.\n\nThe way Grandma\u2019s female characters\u2014many of them queer\u2014dress, decorate their homes, and, most importantly, talk to each other is so beautifully observed, I was sure that Paul Weitz, who wrote and directed this movie, must be a sixtysomething lesbian rather than the guy who wrote Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and directed American Pie. That\u2019s unfair, though. Weitz has made fine movies about the challenges of intergenerational communication (In Good Company), estranged parents and children (Being Flynn and Admission), and the loneliness of single parenthood (About a Boy and, once again, Admission)\u2014and his experience on those projects shines throughout the film, but especially during a bravura scene between Tomlin and Sam Elliott, as Karl, a man from deep in her past.\n\nFor most of the movie, Elle acts like the aggrieved party, mumbling complaints about the friends and family members who disappeared when Vi got sick, but in her interactions with Karl, she\u2019s the one who must make amends. Elle and Karl, who haven\u2019t set eyes on each other for three decades, move swiftly from polite chatter to real talk. \u201cYou wronged me,\u201d Karl declares, with a force that shows the hurt is as raw as it was 49 years earlier when the injury occurred, and for once Elle doesn\u2019t try to deflect with anger or humor. As you get older, Karl says, \u201cold shit just bubbles up.\u201d In confronting her past with Karl, Elle finally seems able to let go of mistakes she\u2019s been feeling guilty about for almost 50 years.\n\nThe scene with Karl is so cathartic, and Tomlin and Elliott\u2019s chemistry is so intense, that subsequent events the movie has been building toward\u2014our eventual introduction to Sage\u2019s mother, Judy (Marcia Gay Harden, wonderful as an impatient, overcaffeinated superlawyer), and the appointment at the abortion clinic\u2014seem slightly anticlimactic. In part that\u2019s because the spotlight drifts away from Tomlin, who, this movie makes clear, has been criminally underused in the supporting roles she\u2019s typically cast in.\n\nGiven our culture\u2019s tendency to avoid the subject of abortion, Grandma\u2019s frank treatment of Sage\u2019s response to her unwanted pregnancy feels revolutionary. The decision to terminate is treated with utmost seriousness, and the responsibility is spread around\u2014Sage for making reckless decisions; Judy for paying more attention to work than to her daughter; and Elle\u2019s generation for failing to make abortion widely available at a reasonable price. But the film isn\u2019t about abortion, or even really about Sage. It\u2019s about grief and the importance of moving on. When Sage forces Elle to ask others for help, Elle has to let down her defenses and allow her loved ones to see that her misanthropy is mostly an act. She pushes people away so she can be alone with her memories of Vi. But she\u2019s also someone\u2019s grandma\u2014and at the end of the movie, she seems ready to recommit to that role.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf17304235215b082e3c9"}}
