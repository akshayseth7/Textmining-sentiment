The fish were found about 6km from the blast site.\n\n\n\nDeng Xiaowen, the head of Tianjin\u2019s environment monitoring centre, vowed to investigate the fish deaths but claimed \u201cit was not uncommon for fish to die en masse in local rivers during summer, due to poor water quality\u201d. He was quoted by the Global Times as saying: \u201cWhen the temperature rises, oxygen will evaporate and fish may die of hypoxia.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dead fish surface near the Tianjin blast site.

Zhang Yunli, the head of a fishing association in Tianjin, told the Global Times the deaths could be the result of a \u201cchange in water\u2019s salinity, which happens every year\u201d .\n\nA military official claimed the fish \u2013 which he named as the stickleback or tiddler \u2013 were \u201cvery sensitive to the environment\u201d. A week after the disaster, military teams are still struggling to decontaminate the area.\n\nThe site has been surrounded with \u201ccofferdam\u201d barriers and drains have been filled with cement, in an attempt at stopping contaminated water seeping out into the sea, according to Xinhua.\n\n\n\nWen Wurui, Tianjin\u2019s environmental chief, denied that the spilled chemicals would \u201csignificantly influence human health\u201d but admitted many challenges remained. He told state media: \u201cWe can\u2019t say when the cleanup work in the blast centre will be finished.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21304235215b082e429"}}
