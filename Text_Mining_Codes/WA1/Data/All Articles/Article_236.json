It was signed on Aug. 6, 1965, in the wake of several failed attempts to remedy a long history of poll taxes and literacy tests that disenfranchised black voters throughout the South.\n\nBut 48 years later, the Roberts court struck down one of the landmark law\u2019s central provisions. And state legislators across the South wasted no time in imposing new voting ID requirements that some worry could roll back many of the civil rights movement\u2019s biggest achievements.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode, Dahlia discusses the long, embattled history of the Voting Rights Act with Ari Berman, author of the new book Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\n\nPlease let us know what you think of our legal affairs podcast.
