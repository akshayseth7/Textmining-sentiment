New hires, Kantor and Streitfeld report, are instructed to forget \u201cpoor habits\u201d acquired at previous jobs. Model Amazon employees are deemed \u201cAmabots.\u201d Steady turnover is described as \u201cpurposeful Darwinism.\u201d In the fifth paragraph of the article, the Times lays out its ominous thesis:\n\nEven as the company tests delivery by drone and ways to restock toilet paper at the push of a bathroom button, it is conducting a little-known experiment in how far it can push white-collar workers, redrawing the boundaries of what is acceptable. The company, founded and still run by Jeff Bezos, rejects many of the popular management bromides that other corporations at least pay lip service to and has instead designed what many workers call an intricate machine propelling them to achieve Mr. Bezos\u2019 ever-expanding ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nContinue reading and you are told shocking anecdotes to back this up, many highlighting Amazon\u2019s alleged mistreatment of women. Former Amazon employee Elizabeth Willet describes feeling forced out by her co-workers and boss after she had a baby and started leaving the office at 4:30 p.m., even though she was starting at 7 a.m. Michelle Williamson, a former employee in Amazon\u2019s restaurant supply business, recalls being told motherhood would prevent her from succeeding at a high level in the company. Molly Jay, a former Kindle worker, says she had to take unpaid leave to care for her dying father and was told her attempts to cut back were \u201ca problem.\u201d Several other women\u2014one with thyroid cancer, another with breast cancer, and one who had a stillborn child\u2014tell the Times they were given little or no leeway during those personal crises, and in some cases essentially had their jobs put on notice.\n\n\n\nThese are undoubtedly horrifying stories. And, sadly, they feel especially ugly coming from a 21-year-old publicly traded company. What\u2019s unclear is how representative they are of Amazon\u2019s culture, past and\u2014more importantly\u2014present. Yes, the Times interviewed an impressive 100-plus current and former Amazon workers for its story. But Amazon currently employs more than 150,000 people, and has employed many more. One hundred is a vanishingly small percentage of that. The most accusatory material in the Times piece also glosses over important details. Most of the truly disturbing stories about how women were treated, for example, don\u2019t mention when those incidents took place. We are allowed to assume that these pernicious interactions are ongoing and commonplace, when in fact we have no way of knowing whether such things happened in the latest quarter, or many years ago.\n\nYou can make a similar critique of the Times\u2019 insinuations about turnover. At Amazon, the article states, \u201cLosers leave or are fired in annual cullings of the staff.\u201d The \u201csteady exodus\u201d is reportedly offset by simultaneous mass-hiring initiatives; at \u201cLinkedIn parties,\u201d Amazon employees are \u201crequired to hand over all their contacts to company recruiters.\u201d But here, again, the Times omits crucial specifics. First, what Amazon\u2019s annual turnover rate actually is. Second, whether that rate includes blue-collar workers in Amazon\u2019s warehouses\u2014jobs with notoriously poor working conditions and high attrition\u2014or just the white-collar ones the article otherwise focuses on. Third, whether any of that \u201cannual culling\u201d is achieved through Amazon\u2019s relatively well known and much less nefarious-sounding \u201cPay to Quit\u201d program, in which warehouse workers once a year are offered up to $5,000 to leave if they\u2019re not in it for the long haul. Finally, the Times says these annual staff thinnings \u201ccan force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas,\u201d but does little to explain why a numbers-obsessed company with thin margins like Amazon would pursue such a strategy\u2014turnover, after all, is costly.\n\n\n\nThe last, giant caveat that seems worth appending to the Times report is how it plays with and to some extent sensationalizes an expectations gap about workplace culture. We\u2019ve been trained to think that \u201cworking at Big Tech Company\u201d should equate to the rosiest description of \u201cworking at Google.\u201d Free gourmet meals. Lavish benefits. In-office scooters. Puppies! Some of the things former Amazon workers tell the Times are truly awful, but half of the scandal comes from them being about Amazon, a Big Tech Company that doesn\u2019t conform to the Google ideal. The sad, horrible fact is that similar anecdotes coming from ex-employees at Goldman, Skadden, Bain, or various fast-growing startups in Silicon Valley would probably be nonstories\u2014that is, until someone actually dies.\n\nAnyway, the Times clearly hit a nerve, because over the past few days it\u2019s provoked a lengthy LinkedIn response from Nick Ciubotariu, head of infrastructure development for Amazon Search Experience, an internal memo from chief executive Jeff Bezos, and about 4,000 comments from readers on the article page. Amazon\u2019s rebuttal has emphasized that the things reported by the Times are not representative of what Amazon is like today. \u201cWhen I interviewed at Amazon, I heard all the horror stories from the past. They\u2019re actually pretty well known in Seattle,\u201d writes Ciubotariu. \u201cI was told they were true, that the company continues to take steps to make things better, and that work-life balance was taken seriously.\u201d Bezos is more pointed. \u201cThe article doesn\u2019t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef0004235215b082e21f"}}
