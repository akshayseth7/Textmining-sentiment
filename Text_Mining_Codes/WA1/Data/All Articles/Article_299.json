The next thing I see when I look up Luis Garcia is separating a madman who threw punches and kicks while I was insulted,\" Martinoli said. \"Everyone will have his version of events, and he probably will deny it, I have no doubt.\u201d\n\nApparently, the Mexican federation wasn\u2019t going to wait for the case to be formally adjudicated, opting to let go of the extraordinarily animated coach one day after the alleged attack came to light.\n\nDeadspin\u2019s Billy Haisley noted on Monday that Martinoli has a reputation for being tough on the Mexican team and Herrera, and there has historically been bad blood between the two men.\n\nIt was surprising to see a coach being fired two days after winning a regional federation\u2019s major tournament, but Mexico actually performed quite poorly at the Gold Cup. The team won both its quarterfinal and semifinal games thanks to terrible referee decisions that inspired cries that opposing teams had been CONCACAF\u2019d out of the tournament\u2014e.g., cheated either by the corruption or the incompetence of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football.\n\nAs Sports Illustrated\u2019s Avi Creditor noted, it\u2019s possible that the still unconfirmed Martinoli incident is just being used as a \u201cconvenient excuse\u201d to get rid of an unwanted coach whose team had underperformed at recent tournaments and who had previously made controversial political statements.\n\nHerrera\u2019s fiery personality and gonzo sideline celebrations made him by far the most entertaining coach at last year\u2019s World Cup. As Slate's Josh Levin noted at the time, he is one of the most GIF-worthy men on the planet.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daefef04235215b082e282"}}
