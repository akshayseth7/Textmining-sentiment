As with \u2018\u2018fatties\u2019\u2019 in high school, or \u2018\u2018thugs,\u2019\u2019 it\u2019s a way to write off a group and justify its mistreatment. Luntz says his research showed that \u2018\u2018if you used the word \u2018illegals,\u2019 you didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything else \u2014 Latino audiences would turn you off.\u2019\u2019 Republicans have long respected Luntz\u2019s messaging skills: This is the man who helped them write the Contract With America and pioneer the phrase \u2018\u2018death tax.\u2019\u2019 Yet G.O.P. candidates for president have repeatedly ignored his warning.\n\nThe slight has become a primary-season refrain, brandished like a conservative calling card. \u2018\u2018We need to keep illegals out,\u2019\u2019 Donald Trump said at the Republican presidential debate earlier this month after being reminded of his earlier claims that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals across the border. The Fox News anchor Chris Wallace picked up the term in a question, and Mike Huckabee volleyed it back, claiming that the solvency of Social Security and Medicare was under threat from \u2018\u2018illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now.\u2019\u2019 In 2007, Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani deployed \u2018\u2018illegals\u2019\u2019 while debating the rights of undocumented workers, and Romney and Rick Perry used it four years later while tangling over who was mowing Romney\u2019s lawn. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m running for office, for Pete\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t have illegals,\u2019\u2019 Romney sputtered.\n\nThe more common phrase, \u2018\u2018illegal immigrant,\u2019\u2019 also implies suspicion, but strip the noun from it and the entire identity of a person who crosses the border without permission, or outstays his or her visa, is reduced to that of a criminal: What rights could he or she be entitled to? \u2018\u2018Illegals\u2019\u2019 becomes the noun, the insult and the dismissal. Designating immigrants as \u2018\u2018illegals\u2019\u2019 also makes it easier not to see the frequent lawbreaking of employers who provide meager pay and unsafe working conditions. And \u2018\u2018illegals\u2019\u2019 implies a permanent caste, as if there is no possibility of becoming anything else \u2014 even if millions of immigrants in the course of American history have shown otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the United States, the idea of the unwanted \u2018\u2018illegal\u2019\u2019 immigrant arose in the last century. \u2018\u2018It dates to the 1924 Immigration Act, when the United States solidified a quota system for immigration, which was explicitly racial,\u2019\u2019 the Yale historian Stephen Pitti told me. \u2018\u2018The quotas were based on the census of 1890 to favor immigrants from Northern Europe.\u2019\u2019 Asians were excluded. Eastern Europeans and Russians (read: Jews) were strictly limited. At the time, however, immigrants from Latin America were exempt from the quotas, to keep a supply of cheap labor flowing to the agribusinesses of the Southwest. As the population of Spanish speakers along the border grew, so did restrictionist sentiment. \u2018\u2018There was an escalation of fear-mongering language,\u2019\u2019 Pitti said. \u2018\u2018 \u2018Illegals\u2019 were stealing jobs, and they were also responsible for a drug epidemic, for bringing in marijuana, for sexual depravity.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1954, the country\u2019s first large-scale deportations began, with military planes and buses swooping into border settlements and cities. It was called Operation Wetback, a derogatory term for people who cross the Rio Grande from Mexico. The official use of \u2018\u2018wetback\u2019\u2019 seems bizarre now, but it was a mainstream term within government for decades. Conservatives like to point out that even the labor leader Cesar Chavez used \u2018\u2018wetbacks,\u2019\u2019 along with \u2018\u2018illegals,\u2019\u2019 in a burst of frustration over strikebreaking in 1972, when undocumented immigrants were brought by employers across the border to thwart unionizers. Plenty of the workers Chavez was trying to organize were also in the country illegally, says Pitti, who is writing a biography of him. Nonetheless, Chavez reportedly supported a government plan to deport a million undocumented immigrants in 1974, making his opposition clear only after a backlash in the Chicano community.\n\nImmigration policy and language have been twin minefields for many decades. The linguistic challenge may now be greater for Republicans, but the parties don\u2019t neatly divide between immigration hawks and doves. It was President Obama whom the head of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group, labeled \u2018\u2018deporter in chief\u2019\u2019 last year. Before Obama proposed work permits and deportation deferrals for about five million undocumented immigrants (out of an estimated 11 million), his administration presided over a record number of deportations.\n\nAdvocates for immigrant rights see the relationship between how people talk and how the government acts and have proposed replacing \u2018\u2018illegal immigrants\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018undocumented workers\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018undocumented immigrants.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018In an increasingly diverse society in which undocumented immigrants are integrated in all walks of life, language belongs to the people whose stories are being told,\u2019\u2019 Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and activist who revealed his own undocumented status in The New York Times Magazine in 2011, wrote in Time. \u2018\u2018To be an undocumented person in the U.S., after all, is to live a life dictated by getting the proper documents.\u2019\u2019 If immigrants are principally defined by their missing papers, their path to legal status becomes far more tenable. Imagine if we started calling all immigrants \u2018\u2018dreamers,\u2019\u2019 which is how many of us think of our own ancestors. The word has been adopted by young adults who came to the United States as children from the Dream Act, a bill that would give them a path to permanent residency, if it is ever passed.\n\nOn the political right, \u2018\u2018undocumented\u2019\u2019 has few takers. To conservatives, it smacks of soft-pedaling, which makes it difficult to see which safe and neutral terms Republicans trying to court both hard-liners and Latinos can fall back on. Media outlets are similarly searching for neutrality, and they\u2019re not in accord. The Associated Press dropped \u2018\u2018illegal immigrant\u2019\u2019 in 2013, soon after NBC News and ABC News. The New York Times announced it would encourage reporters and editors to \u2018\u2018consider alternatives,\u2019\u2019 but \u2018\u2018illegal immigrant\u2019\u2019 has shown up dozens of times in the paper in the two years since. The same goes for The Washington Post, CBS and The Wall Street Journal. The term of art that statutes and courts have used since the 18th century \u2014 \u2018\u2018alien\u2019\u2019 \u2014 hardly bridges the gap. It comes from the Latin for \u2018\u2018of or belonging to others,\u2019\u2019 and was codified in the first federal law that addressed granting citizenship to foreigners \u2014 which allowed for naturalizing only an \u2018\u2018alien\u2019\u2019 who was a \u2018\u2018free white person.\u2019\u2019 Led by Democrats, California decided earlier this month to delete \u2018\u2018alien\u2019\u2019 from its labor code.\n\nThe controversy over what to call people who enter this country without official permission will persist as long as their standing remains uncertain. Even the toughest talkers about immigration make the occasional rhetorical concession. \u2018\u2018I said we need to build a wall,\u2019\u2019 Trump said at the Aug. 6 debate. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall.\u2019\u2019 Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Republican candidates for president who have ties to the Latino community (Bush by marriage, Rubio by birth), spoke of immigrants with respect. Bush talked about \u2018\u2018people\u2019\u2019 who \u2018\u2018want to provide for their family.\u2019\u2019 Rubio went with \u2018\u2018people coming across the border.\u2019\u2019 They also talked about fences and border enforcement, but they didn\u2019t sound quite so heartless. \u2018\u2018If you ask me the single most important group the G.O.P. has to improve among, I pick Latinos,\u2019\u2019 Luntz told me. And as the number of Latino voters grows, the party alienates them at its eventual peril.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf35d04235215b082e4bd"}}
