After all, pretty much everything we know about the Universe is information sent via electromagnetic radiation, and as we press on into the cosmos we\u2019ll need to know something about how it works.\n\nSo let me illuminate you:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYou probably don\u2019t think much about light, but holy wow does it store a lot of information into teeny little photons. This is a part of astronomy, of science, that reaches into my brain and tickles my mind; we see objects so far away that just the numbers describing their distance seem huge beyond imagining, yet that trickle of light tells us what those objects are, how far they are, what they\u2019re made of, how hot they are, how rapidly they\u2019re moving, whether and how fast they\u2019re rotating, how strong any magnetic field they might have is, even giving us hints of the existence of things we can\u2019t see. And even then, there\u2019s still so much more.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2aa04235215b082e459"}}
