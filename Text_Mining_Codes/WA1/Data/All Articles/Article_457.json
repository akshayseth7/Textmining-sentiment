To which activist Julius Jones responded, more or less, that since systematic mistreatment was a problem created by the mostly white United States power structure, it should also be incumbent on that power structure, and not the people it's systematically oppressing, to solve the problem.\n\n\n\nIn any case, Clinton's objection in general terms is now somewhat moot: Several anti-police brutality activists working under the name Campaign Zero just launched a very detailed website advocating criminal justice reforms in 10 different areas\u2014ranging from marijuana law to stop-and-frisk profiling to the prosecution of police-involved shootings to the distribution of body cameras\u2014that would address the central concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\n\nScreen shot/Campaign Zero\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(Brief semantic interlude: Black Lives Matter is a specific activist organization but also a slogan/chant/hashtag used by a wider group of activist individuals and groups who are not necessarily formally affiliated. Campaign Zero was launched not by the Black Lives Matter organization per se but by four activists involved with the larger movement, including prominent Twitter and protest presences DeRay McKesson and Johnetta \"Netta\" Elzie.)", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf09b04235215b082e320"}}
