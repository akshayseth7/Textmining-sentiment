Fifty-four of the dead have so far been identified.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The warehouse explosion site in Tianjin.

Many of them are migrant workers whose deaths she believes could be brushed under the carpet. By Monday the list contained 132 names. The oldest was a 73-year-old called Lu Fuyou; the youngest a 17-year-old firefighter, Wang Shengmin.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s handling is secretive,\u201d the activist compiling the database told the Guardian. \u201cI do not believe the government would voluntarily publish the list of the missing people.\n\n\u201cWe started making this list yesterday, and before that the government had not even mentioned the number of contractor firefighters who were missing,\u201d added the activist who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. \u201cIt\u2019s just like in the 2008 [Sichuan] earthquake [when] the government would not publish the missing people list voluntarily.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2008 earthquake dissident artist Ai Weiwei launched a campaign to record the names of thousands of Chinese students who died in poorly constructed classrooms. Only a year later did the government publish its own list of at least 5,335 children and teenagers who died.\n\nDozens of protestors gathered outside a Tianjin hotel where media briefings are being held on Monday to demand compensation for their wrecked homes.\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.

This is simply our only channel to attract the government\u2019s attention. Up until now they have not acknowledged us at all,\u201d Li Jiao, whose home was close to the blast site, told Reuters.\n\nThe South China Morning Post said protesters carried banners reading: \u201cWe want the truth!\u201d and \u201cWe love the party and the government, please buy back our apartments\u201d.\n\nTianjin\u2019s deputy mayor, He Shushan, said he was confident authorities would soon \u201cgive victims and the people a full explanation\u201d. But the disaster has exposed the widespread mistrust of the government in China with online outrage over how officials allowed hazardous materials to be stored so close to residential areas in clear violation of official guidelines.\n\nThere has also been intense speculation that powerful government figures are linked to Ruihai International Logistics, the company that owns the warehouse believed to have caused the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the authorities allow such dangerous warehouses to be built near residential blocks shows that they care about only their own interests rather than the wellbeing of the people,\u201d the Chinese activist said. \u201cThey are indifferent to people\u2019s lives and their most basic human rights as long as it suits their own interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the migrant workers\u2019 lives that are worthless to them,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the lives of the middle class families either.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Luna Lin", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0f704235215b082e387"}}
