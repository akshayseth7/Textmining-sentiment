DiCaprio will play Chicago serial killer H.H. Holmes, the infamous murderer who built his hotel (also known as the Murder Castle ) just in time for the 1893 World\u2019s Fair in Chicago.\n\nThis villainy could rival the crazed brutality DiCaprio brought to Tarantino\u2019s Django Unchained: Holmes admitted to killing 27 people, and it\u2019s suspected he could have killed many more. His hotel was straight out of a horror film, with windowless rooms, dead-end hallways, gas jets in the walls, and a human-size kiln. Larson\u2019s book weaves Holmes\u2019 story with that of Daniel H. Burnham, the architect behind that 1893 World\u2019s Fair.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf30004235215b082e475"}}
