Advocates for such therapy\u2014mostly conservative Christians\u2014insist that the ban violates would-be therapists\u2019 freedom of speech. Following the court\u2019s move, they\u2019ll likely turn their sights to a similar law in New Jersey in another attempt to appeal their case to the justices.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, California and New Jersey\u2019s bans on anti-gay \u201cconversion therapy\u201d are very obviously constitutional. They don\u2019t forbid parents or relatives or friends or preachers from attempting to convert gay people to heterosexuality. These laws only prevent licensed mental health professionals from \u201cconverting\u201d patients; if they break the law, they simply lose their license. It\u2019s a narrowly tailored, eminently sensible way to curb a dangerous, suicide-inducing practice that is condemned by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Medical Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGiven that these bans are laser-focused to target a single, destructive practice, I\u2019d be surprised if the Supreme Court agreed to review the New Jersey ban\u2014or any other similarly worded law. The constitutional question is just so easy that the case would be a waste of the justices\u2019 time at this point. My greater fear is that a dark blue state will overreach, pulling non-professionals into the sweep of the law. If that happens, the conservative Christians who want to force young Americans into the misery of \u201cconversion\u201d would actually have a case.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2ac04235215b082e45b"}}
