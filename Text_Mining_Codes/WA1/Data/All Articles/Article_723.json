The Juno star, who memorably came out on Valentine\u2019s Day last year and who was in Iowa filming a new Vice show this week, approached the pork-chop-grilling Republican hopeful to ask him an open-ended question about whether \u201creligious liberty\u201d could lead to the persecution of members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Cruz expressed no such fears. Instead, he kept his remarks focused on Christian business owners, who he says are the ones who are actually facing persecution for refusing to provide services to gay couples. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019re seeing Bible-believing Christians being persecuted for living to their faith,\u201d Cruz told Page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe exchange was captured on camera by a number of outlets including CBS News (you can watch their video of it above.) During an interview after the exchange, Cruz suggested to ABC News that he did not know he was talking to Page.\n\n\n\nOne important fact check about the story of the Iowa couple that Cruz tells early in the video: Dick and Betty Odgaard are indeed a Mennonite couple who agreed to pay a $5,000 fine late last year after they refused to provide service to a gay couple. But though Cruz repeatedly suggests the couple owns a church, in reality they own a former church that they converted into an art gallery, flower shop, and bistro that they then ran as a wedding venue. So the Texan\u2019s taking some rather large liberties when he suggests that requiring the Odgaards to allow a gay couple to wed in their for-profit business would be the same as \u201cforcing a Muslim imam to conduct a Jewish wedding ceremony.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21304235215b082e42a"}}
