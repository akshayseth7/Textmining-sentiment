Entertainment Inc.\n\nThis article originally appeared in New York magazine.\n\nAs the summer movie season comes to a close, three big fall film festivals loom\u2014Venice, Telluride, and Toronto\u2014that will start clarifying this year\u2019s Oscar race. But what about the movies we\u2019ve already had the chance to see? Plenty of terrific films debuted in the first half of the year, and it\u2019s entirely possible that half of this year\u2019s Best Picture nominees could come from the movies that have already been seen and vetted at film festivals and in general release.\n\n\n\nBut are any of them better than Mad Max: Fury Road, the out-of-the-teal-blue-sky action spectacular that wowed critics earlier this year and deserves real awards consideration going forward?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the question that\u2019s been on my mind since I saw George Miller\u2019s gonzo reboot last April. It\u2019s become my cinematic high-water mark, the one I\u2019ve been measuring most new movies against. I\u2019ve previewed several of this year\u2019s big fall films, and though some of them have great performances, I still haven\u2019t seen anything that knocked me out like Charlize Theron in Mad Max. This year\u2019s costume-design category will no doubt be packed with period pieces like Cinderella and Carol, but they don\u2019t deserve a trophy over the striking postapocalyptic threads that Jenny Beavan put together for Mad Max. And while most of our Best Director candidates are likely still to come, and could include perennial nominees like David O. Russell, Tom Hooper, and Steven Spielberg, it would be hard for me to believe that any of them wrangled a more difficult and ultimately fruitful production than the 70-year-old Miller.\n\n\n\nSo what kind of chance does Mad Max have? In the below-the-line categories like editing, production design, makeup, sound editing, sound mixing, and costumes, I\u2019d give it promising odds; depending on what\u2019s to come, it could lay claim to cinematography and visual-effects nominations as well. But there are three other nominations I wonder about, and the two most tantalizing are Theron for Best Actress and Miller for Best Director.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard of the Best Actress field, several of this year\u2019s assumed locks are laboring in subpar films, which could give Theron an opening if she campaigns for it. Miller might be a better bet: The directors\u2019 branch often goes its own way, and I think enough of those voters will be sufficiently wowed to consider him. (Miller\u2019s inclusion is the first thing I thought of when I read that Edgar Wright was asked to join the Academy\u2014that\u2019s one vote I bet he\u2019ll get.)\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the big ask, Best Picture. Could Mad Max: Fury Roadreally convince enough Oscar voters to take it that seriously?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Academy has been susceptible to well-realized sci-fi a few times over the past few years, as evidenced by Best Picture nods for District 9 and Avatar. Those pictures had additional heft and social gravitas that legitimized them with Oscar voters\u2014District 9was a sci-fi gloss on apartheid, while Avatar wore its green heart on its sleeve\u2014and a smart campaign for Mad Max would do well to emphasize the film\u2019s lauded feminist bona fides. A Best Picture nod might still be the film\u2019s most difficult to nab, but only a fool would count out Furiosa.\n\n\n\nAs for this year\u2019s other already-screened contenders \u2026\n\n\n\nSundance\u2019s big buy Me and Earl and the Dying Girl sank without a trace this summer, but other films from the year\u2019s first fest are well positioned for the awards race. Foremost among them is the sweet and sensitive immigrant romance Brooklyn (out this November), which could sneak into the Best Picture race and also pick up a nomination for Saoirse Ronan as Best Actress. Lily Tomlin will also be considered for this week\u2019s Grandma, though it remains to be seen if she can parlay that support past likely nods from the Golden Globes and Indie Spirits. And Jason Segel won raves for his work as David Foster Wallace in The End of the Tour, but he\u2019ll have to survive an onslaught of flashy fall performances if he wants to be remembered by voters.\n\n\n\nCannes also brought some significant contenders, like Youth, a Michael Caine dramedy that will play well to older voters and could score Jane Fonda a Best Supporting Actress nod for her scorching cameo; and the Hungarian holocaust drama Son of Saul, which may have an impact even beyond the Best Foreign Language Film category. Todd Haynes\u2019 immaculate lesbian romance Carol will find plenty of partisans, though it remains to be seen if leads Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara will compete for Best Actress; I\u2019ve heard that the Weinsteins want Mara in the Supporting race, which would be this year\u2019s clearest-cut example of category fraud. But to my mind, the likeliest Oscar contender to emerge out of Cannes was Pixar's Inside Out, which will put the animation studio back into the Best Picture derby. (It'll also trump the successful Minions for Best Animated Feature.)\n\nI wonder, too, if Ex Machina might be a looming Oscar player. The spring sleeper hit earned strong reviews and deserves a Best Supporting Actor nod for Oscar Isaac, who's having a terrific year. Other early releases that could still be standing include the Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy, which is very Academy-friendly and boasts a well-received performance from Paul Dano; Woman in Gold, which Harvey Weinstein will push Helen Mirren for; and Diary of a Teenage Girl, which at least warrants screenplay consideration.\n\nThe Best Documentary race is already crowded, with voters mulling titles like Amy, Best of Enemies, Cartel Land, Going Clear, The Wolfpack, and What Happened, Miss Simone? And there will be no dearth of contenders from this year's big action crop to fill the Visual Effects and Sound categories.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02d04235215b082e2c4"}}
