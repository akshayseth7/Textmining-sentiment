Collectively, those numbers mean 2015 has been record hot so far. What\u2019s more, the last 12 months (from April 2014 to March 2015) was the warmest 12-month period on record, according to the NASA data. The previous warmest 12-month period ended just last month, so don\u2019t write this one down in your diary in ink.\n\nVivian Selbo\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe news comes amid increasingly confident forecasts that there will be a strengthening El Ni\u00f1o for the remainder of 2015, which could spark a litany of impacts worldwide, not the least of which is the more efficient transport of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere. That liberated heat from the Pacific Ocean should boost global temperatures to never-before-recorded levels, making 2015 the warmest year ever measured.\n\nCompared to last year at this time (when most of the weather world, myself included, was freaking out about a coming huge El Nino, but it didn't pan out) the data looks even more convincing now.\n\nIn fact, off-the-charts warm water is already lurking just below the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean:\n\nBesides El Ni\u00f1o, a more worrying, longer-term trend is also taking shape. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a decades-long periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean that tends to favor bursts of accelerated global warming. As I wrote last October, the Pacific appears to be in the midst of a shift into a new warm phase that could last 20 years or so.\n\nThe PDO\u2014or, \u201cthe blob\u201d as it\u2019s been referred to recently\u2014is starting to freak out some scientists. There are emerging signs of a major shift in the Pacific Ocean\u2019s food chain, including a dearth of plankton, tropical fish sightings near Alaska, and thousands of starving sea lion pups stranded on the California coast. As Earth\u2019s largest ocean, what happens in the Pacific affects the weather virtually planet-wide, and that means an \u201cimminent\u201d jump in global warming may have already begun\u2014spurred on by the PDO.\n\nThe PDO has skyrocketed to record-high monthly levels over the past four months. In fact, there have only been four other similarly warm four-month bursts of the PDO in the last 115 years (in 1940, 1941, 1993, and 1997). A quick look at the historical record (for both 15 years prior to and 15 years after the bursts) shows that global temperatures rose at twice the rate of the 20th century average immediately after these bursts.\n\nCombined with the overall long-term warming trend from climate change, the emergence of the PDO warm phase means the current state of the world\u2019s oceans has little precedent.\n\nIf the NMME is right, not a lot of good analogs for the upcoming summer SST pattern.
