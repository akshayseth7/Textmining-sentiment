The actions have succeeded in pushing police and criminal justice reform to the forefront of the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.

It calls for the establishment of a new national standard authorising police officers to use deadly force \u201conly when there is an imminent threat to an officer\u2019s life or the life of another person\u201d and the use of deadly force is \u201cstrictly unavoidable\u201d. Under a 1985 US supreme court ruling, officers may currently use deadly force if they believe a fleeing suspect poses \u201ca significant threat\u201d of killing or seriously injuring someone.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 platform also requests further legislation mandating all police officers to wear body cameras, lowering the standard of proof for convictions in federal civil rights inquiries, and banning police union contracts that they say obstruct investigations into officers responsible for fatalities.\n\nPacknett said the policies had been compiled over several months and incorporated some recommendations made earlier this year by President Obama\u2019s White House policing taskforce, on which she sat.\n\nIt also comprises ideas from more than two dozen activists and organisers to ensure it is \u201ctruly reflective of the broad and decentralised nature of the movement,\u201d she said. McKesson said: \u201cIt\u2019s based on what we have learned over the past year and on direct feedback from protesters around the country.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAmong other requests, the group also called on Friday for new laws to prohibit police departments from operating minimum quotas for traffic tickets and arrests, and to limit court fines and fees for low-income people. The aggressive prosecution for minor offences of black residents in Ferguson, Missouri, is seen as being partly responsible for the unleashing of dramatic protests in the St Louis suburb after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, last year.\n\n\n\nThe campaigners also called for laws requiring departments to devise plans for \u201crecruitment and retention of minority police officers\u201d. While two-thirds of Ferguson\u2019s population is black, more than 90% of its police officers were white at the time of Brown\u2019s death, leading to further tensions and alienation, according to residents.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest DeRay McKesson in Ferguson in November.

Such offences have been aggressively policed under so-called \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory, the abolition of which is called for by the protesters.\n\nThe manifesto was published by McKesson, Packnett, Johnetta Elzie and Samuel Sinyangwe. The four are co-founders of We The Protesters, a prominent section of a wider protest movement that is frequently referred to, in general terms, as Black Lives Matter.\n\nPacknett, 30, is an activist in St Louis, and sat on Obama\u2019s taskforce. McKesson, 30, and Elzie, 25, are among the most prominent protesters thrust to the national stage by the demonstrations in Ferguson. Sinyangwe, 24, is a community organiser and policy specialist.\n\nWhile the name has been applied to a loosely affiliated collection of activist groups in the year since the Ferguson demonstrations, Black Lives Matter is a single organisation that was founded following the death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all part of the movement for black lives, which is different to Black Lives Matter as an organisation,\u201d said Sinyangwe. \u201cThe movement is wider than that organisation. They and we are pieces of it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn New Hampshire last week, a group of activists from the Boston chapter of Black Lives Matter had planned to disrupt Clinton\u2019s campaign event. But the group was prevented from entering and instead held a heated private meeting with the Democratic frontrunner, who has yet to unveil formal platforms on racial justice or criminal justice reform.\n\nRelated: 'Things will never be the same': the oral history of a new civil rights movement\n\nA video recording, released this week, showed a frank yet tense conversation: the activists accused Clinton of supporting criminal justice policies under her husband\u2019s administration that they called \u201cyour mistakes\u201d \u2013 including the draconian 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which is widely argued to have adversely affected African Americans.\n\nAsked by Black Lives Matter activist Julius Jones to explain \u201chow do you actually feel that\u2019s different than you did before?\u201d Clinton responded: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you change hearts, you change laws, you change allocation of resources, you change the way systems operate. You\u2019re not going to change every heart, you\u2019re not. But at the end of the day we can do a whole lot to change some hearts, and change some systems, and create more opportunities for people who deserve to have them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Jones was sharply critical of Clinton\u2019s response. \u201cThis whole idea of \u2018You can\u2019t change hearts\u2019 \u2013 well, it\u2019s hopeless,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s doubly damning to hear it from Hillary Clinton, who bears a unique personal responsibility and is also trying to lead our country.\u201d\n\nClinton, her main Democratic rival Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, have all openly courted prominent members of this new civil rights movement. McKesson was invited to Clinton\u2019s formal campaign launch in New York in June and on Monday engaged with Sanders directly on Twitter to organise a meeting centred on the Democratic candidates\u2019 racial justice platform.\n\nThe Guardian understands the meeting between Sanders and McKesson has yet to take place.\n\nThe manifesto authors credited the protest movement with contributing to the decision by Sanders and O\u2019Malley to publish policy proposals on racial justice \u2013 and for some of the content therein \u2013 and by Clinton to outline specific reforms in her campaign speeches.\n\nThe movement appears determined to ratchet up the pressure as the presidential nomination contest continues. Earlier this month Sanders was forced to hand over the microphone at one of his own rallies in Seattle, when a pair of Black Lives Matter activists took to the stage and demanded the crowd observe four and a half minutes of silence in memory of Michael Brown.\n\nHillary Clinton meets with Black Lives Matter activists.\n\n\u201cI was going to tell Bernie how racist this city is, even with all of these progressives,\u201d said 23-year-old activist Marissa Janae Johnson, amid boos from the crowd as she took to the stage. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already done that for me.\u201d\n\nDaunasia Yancey, another of the Black Lives Matter Boston activists present during the meeting with Clinton last week, said that presidential candidates across the political spectrum should expect to have events shut down by activists mobilising under their banner.\n\n\u201cWhen white people do it, it\u2019s political engagement and revolution \u2013 and when black people do it, it\u2019s violent and disruptive and the worst thing to ever happen, when in reality the worst thing to ever happen was Tamir Rice dying on an Ohio playground,\u201d she said, referring to the 12-year-old killed by a white police officer in Cleveland last year.\n\n\u201cThe system isn\u2019t broken. It has been built like this and we\u2019re saying we have to operate in a new way,\u201d Yancey said.\n\n\u201cEven now, I\u2019m baffled that candidates aren\u2019t just coming out with [racial justice policies] and that they are surprised to be shut down. We\u2019re here. It\u2019s very clear what the movement\u2019s goals are and what we\u2019re willing to do to advance that message.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman holds up a sign reading Black Lives Matter in the street in Ferguson, Missouri, on the anniversary of Michael Brown\u2019s death. Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Xinhua Press/Corbis\n\nIn July, a group of Black Lives Matter activists disrupted a Democratic presidential forum at the progressive Netroots Nation conference, which featured a joint appearance by Sanders and O\u2019Malley. Clinton did not attend the conference.\n\nThe candidates appeared ill-prepared and defensive. \u201cBlack lives of course matter,\u201d Sanders told the protesters. \u201cI spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and dignity, but if you don\u2019t want me to be here that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t want to out-scream people.\u201d The response spawned internet memes and the hashtag \u201cBernie so black,\u201d a reflection of the growing generational divide over how to confront the challenges facing the black community today.\n\nO\u2019Malley tried another tack: \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter,\u201d a phrase that was met with criticism.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior White House domestic policy adviser under Bill Clinton, said all Democratic nominees were still under pressure to strike a rhetorical balance on racial justice, adding that the issue was now firmly established as a pivotal Democratic policy platform for the 2016 election.\n\nHe argued that the issue now facing all Democratic candidates was how to sell a reform package in the most rhetorically inclusive way.\n\n\u201cObviously there comes a time in the life in every nation, John F Kennedy and LBJ certainly found themselves at such a moment, when the distinctive claims of certain groups in society have to be recognised for what they are. In the area of policing and criminal justice we may have reached such a moment,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Black lives don't matter, apparently, to Republican candidates for president | Steven W Thrasher\n\n\u201cAnd the only question is whether one wants to confine the rhetorical and policy response to African Americans, whether one wants to fold into that the parallel between, for example, low-income Hispanics who are disproportionately represented in American prisons, as African Americans are.\u201d\n\nThe issue has attracted little discussion and debate among Republican nominees. At the first televised debate between Republicans leading the polls, just one question related to policing was asked and directed at the Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, who was given less than a minute to respond.\n\nNeither of the Republican frontrunners, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, have issued formal policy platforms on police reform, an omission noted on the Campaign Zero website.\n\nThe group said they hoped to engage the Republicans. \u201cThis is a conservative issue \u2013 the government intruding on people\u2019s lives in the most extreme way,\u201d said Sinyangwe. Packnett said: \u201cThis is really a historical moment for our country, and I think it would be irresponsible for any candidate to not address that.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1c304235215b082e409"}}
