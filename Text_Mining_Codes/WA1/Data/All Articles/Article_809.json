The store\u2019s latest spot has nothing to do with yuletide cheer, but it\u2019s well worth a watch: It stars a young, charming ballerina, who on a free day at home chooses to prance and pirouette to Elton John\u2019s \u201cTiny Dancer.\u201d\n\nThe ad was made for John Lewis\u2019 home insurance division, and it gets its point across with the precious glasses, clocks, and curtains almost toppled by the girl\u2019s freewheeling waltz. The dance itself is pitch-perfect: It deftly captures those childhood moments of freedom in which one\u2019s actions might freak out a sibling and definitely freak out a pet. If you\u2019re going to brush a brisk, heartfelt scene of intimacy with the taint of consumerism, this is how it\u2019s done.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf30b04235215b082e480"}}
