He is also an adrenaline junkie, and about a year and a half ago he suffered a serious mountain biking accident that led to losing a testicle and affected his ability to sustain an erection for a few months. Even though he healed up just fine with no impact to his testosterone level or his ability to reproduce, he has become significantly more insecure and aggressively jealous of me because, I believe, he sees me, his younger brother whom he grew up teasing, as now being more of a man than he is. At first the jealousy remained verbal when he would make snide remarks about my ability to satisfy my girlfriend. But recently, he\u2019s adopted the practice of hitting me in the nuts by surprise whenever we\u2019re together and then saying things like how I should be able to take it if I were a real man. It\u2019s become so frequent that I physically stay away from my brother when we\u2019re in the same space. I don\u2019t want to be in pain, literally, every time I hang out with my brother but how do I tell him to stop without making him feel upset and depressed about what happened to him? It\u2019s a sensitive topic for everyone in the family but I seem to be getting the brunt of his anger. Help!\n\n\u2014Punching Bag\n\nDear Punching,\n\nHe\u2019s got a lot of stones for turning his anger about his half-empty sack onto you. He suffered a blow, but lucky for him evolution bestows testicles in pairs. If he is cosmetically bothered, he can explore whether he\u2019s a candidate for a testicular prosthesis. But what he\u2019s not allowed to do is try to smash the jewels of his baby brother in some bizarre quest for cosmic retribution. You don\u2019t want to hang out with him because when you do, he literally takes a fist to what\u2019s hanging. It\u2019s time to stop letting your big bro get away with behaving like a school bully. That first means preventing him from doing you bodily harm. Have a firm, serious conversation with him in which you state he is to never\u2014not even in supposed \u201cjest\u201d\u2014touch your balls again. Follow Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s advice to \u201cSpeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d by having this talk while casually holding a baseball bat or golf club. If things go well and he apologizes, suggest that you guys go out and hit some other balls. If it doesn\u2019t go well and he reaches for your crotch, you\u2019ll be better equipped to parry his blows. This cock of the walk lost part of his set, but he should be grateful everything turned out fine (and believe me, women won\u2019t care about this). Adverse experiences are traditionally supposed to help boy-men like your brother grow up.\n\n\u2014Prudie\n\nDear Prudie,\n\nI recently became involved with a co-worker I met during my summer internship. Men I\u2019ve dated in the past have been relatively immature and inconsiderate, so I\u2019m excited to have met a potential partner who embodies neither of these traits. However, there are a few problems. While this man wasn\u2019t my boss, he held the same position within the company that my boss did, and I reported to him on a number of projects. I\u2019m worried about the scandal our relationship could cause should it come to light, and also about the integrity of letters of recommendation I may need down the road. There is also considerable age difference between us\u2014I\u2019m 20, he\u2019s 36. While it doesn\u2019t bother me, I do see it as a major barrier to my family and friends accepting our relationship. The few close friends I\u2019ve told have been shocked at our age difference and professional association, and their reactions stopped me from sharing the news with others. Lastly, he\u2019s financially well off and plans to spend considerable money to fly me out to see him when I\u2019m back at college. While I very much like him for his personality, I\u2019d be lying if I said his financial stability wasn\u2019t also attractive. I worry about being perceived as a stereotypical gold-digger, and also about having to explain to my parents where I\u2019m going and who\u2019s paying my passage. Should I distance myself from a potentially wonderful partner for the reasons listed above? Or can you give me the green light to see where time takes us?\n\n\u2014Unequal Footing\n\nDear Unequal,\n\nIt\u2019s too bad he\u2019s unwilling to fly out to meet you because there\u2019s something about a man in his mid-30s showing up at the dorm to take his girlfriend out that would put your situation in perspective. I\u2019m assuming the callow young men you\u2019ve dated previously are your age; by definition they would be immature because you\u2019re all just barely out of your teens. I\u2019m not entirely buying the case you make for the maturity of your new amour. He had an affair with an intern who in part reported to him\u2014that betrays a certain lack of judgment on his part. (Perhaps he was taking a sick day when the memo with the subject line \u201cDo Not Have Sex With the Interns\u201d went out.) You\u2019re likely a lot more immature than you think you are because, well, you\u2019re only 20 years old. Other evidence that you\u2019re not quite grown up is that you\u2019re worried about telling your parents this guy is buying you a plane ticket. You may be impressed at his ability to whip out a credit card, but if you finish your education and launch your career, you\u2019ll discover that one day you can pay for your own travels. I agree that it\u2019s a good idea to keep your fling a secret\u2014and the most efficacious way to do that is not to extend it into the fall term. You had a romantic adventure with an older man. Your male schoolmates also had experiences this summer that presumably will be part of their maturation process.
