When the accusations became public, the family went into crisis mode, insisting that Josh had reformed and that the media covering the claims was intent on \u201cexploiting women.\u201d\n\nJosh himself took to his family\u2019s Facebook page to absolve himself of his past indiscretions and assure the world he was back on a righteous path:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life. I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life. I would do anything to go back to those teen years and take different actions. In my life today, I am so very thankful for God\u2019s grace, mercy and redemption.\n\nAnd his wife, for her part, certainly seemed to believe it:\n\nAnd when you, our sweet fans, first met me when Josh asked me to marry him... I was able to say, \u201cYes\u201d knowing who Josh really is - someone who had gone down a wrong path and had humbled himself before God and those whom he had offended. Someone who had received the help needed to change the direction of his life and do what is right. I want to say thank you to those who took time over a decade ago to help Josh in a time of crisis. Your investment changed his life from going down the wrong path to doing what is right.\n\nBut data released online in the wake of the hack on Ashley Madison\u2019s servers certainly seems to show otherwise. Someone using a credit card belonging to a Joshua J. Duggar, with a billing address that matches the home in Fayetteville, Arkansas owned by his grandmother Mary\u2014a home that was consistently shown on their now-cancelled TV show, and in which Anna Duggar gave birth to her first child\u2014paid a total of $986.76 for two different monthly Ashley Madison subscriptions from February of 2013 until May of 2015.\n\nAccording to the data, Josh Duggar was paying Ashley Madison in order to find an extramarital partner for the following acts:\n\n\u201cConventional Sex,\u201d Experimenting with Sex Toys,\u201d One-Night Stands,\u201d \u201cOpen to Experimentation,\u201d \u201cGentleness,\u201d \u201cGood With Your Hands,\u201d Sensual Massage,\u201d \u201cExtended Foreplay/Teasing,\u201d \u201cBubble Bath for 2,\u201d \u201cLikes to Give Oral Sex,\u201d \u201cLikes to Receive Oral Sex,\u201d \u201cSomeone I Can Teach,\u201d \u201cSomeone Who Can Teach Me,\u201d \u201cKissing,\u201d \u201cCuddling & Hugging,\u201d \u201cSharing Fantasies,\u201d \u201cSex Talk.\u201d\n\nAnd here are the turn-ons that he offered up in service of finding a compatible person other than his wife with which to engage in those acts:\n\n\u201cA Professional/Well Groomed,\u201d \u201cStylish/Classy,\u201d \u201cCasual Jeans/T-shirt Type,\u201d \u201cMuscular/Fit Body,\u201d \u201dPetite Figure,\u201d \u201cTall Height,\u201d \u201cShort Height,\u201d \u201cLong Hair,\u201d\u201dShort Hair,\u201d \u201cGirl Next Door,\u201d \u201cNaughty Girl,\u201d \u201cSense of Humor,\u201d \u201cImagination,\u201d \u201cCreative and Adventurous,\u201d \u201cRelaxed and Easy Going,\u201d \u201cAggressive/Take Charge Nature,\u201d \u201cConfidence,\u201d \u201cDiscretion/Secrecy,\u201d \u201cA Good Listener,\u201d \u201cGood Personal Hygiene,\u201d \u201cAverage Sex Drive,\u201d \u201cHigh Sex Drive,\u201d \u201cDislikes Routine,\u201d \u201cHas a Secret Love Nest,\u201d \u201cDisease Free,\u201d \u201cDrug Free,\u201d and \u201cNatural Breasts.\u201d\n\nIn July 2014*, he seems to have started a second account that was linked to his home in Oxon Hill, Maryland, where he spent his time lobbying against causes like same-sex marriage. The birthday listed in the data for Duggar\u2019s first account is February 3, 1988, one month off Duggar\u2019s actual birthday of March 3, 1988. The birthday listed for the second account is March 2, 1988.\n\nThe two accounts overlap by a period of a few months. When he launched the second account, Duggar paid an initial fee of $250 that appears to have gone toward the purchase of an \u201caffair guarantee\u201d:\n\nCustomers who buy 1,000 credits for $250 receive a money-back \u201caffair guarantee,\u201d if they don\u2019t have an affair within three months.\n\nFrom the raw data of Josh\u2019s first account (Josh_the_man):\n\n159494:(11176060,\u20192011-10-13 23:41:52\u2019,0,\u20192012-12-07 00:07:22\u2019,0,2,2,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,\u2019josh_the_man\u2019,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,\u2019Fayetteville\u2019,\u201972764\u2019,4,36.179938,-94.145696,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,\u20191988-03-02\u2019,\u2019Looking for you!\u2019,1,86184,183,4,1,0,5,2,\u2019|7|23|15|46|37|38|48|36|28|42|43|50|51|39|29|49|18|\u2019,\u2019\u2019,\u2019I\\\u2019m really open!

You can read the statement in full here.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of the post identified both sets of raw data as being from Josh\u2019s second account, when a portion actually belonged to the first.
