Diehl, who held himself out as an anti-gay and anti-choice family-values conservative, was caught exchanging texts with the college freshman that had such bons mots in them as, \u201cWill have my way with you\u201d and \u201cAnd leave you quivering,\u201d which were obtained from her phone, where the intern had Diehl listed as \u201cFrank Underwood.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nNow another school year is starting, and Missouri legislators are trying to figure out how to prevent future embarrassing scandals involving \u201cfamily values\u201d hypocrites who try to strip women\u2019s reproductive rights away with one hand while sending dirty messages to college girls with the other. Republican state Rep. Kevin Engler was chosen to lead the effort to teach his fellow legislators to keep their hands off the girls in between rounds of attacking contraception and abortion access. He sent out a memo of recommendations, including mandatory sexual harassment training and banning personal text messaging with interns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs reported by the Kansas City Star, two of his fellow Republicans immediately chimed in, insisting that the real solution here is to start measuring hemlines. Rep. Bill Kidd responded to the memo with just the suggestion: \u201cIntern dress code.\u201d\n\nAnother Republican, Nick King, rapidly agreed, writing, \u201cWe need a good, modest, conservative dress code for both the males and females.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemoving one more distraction will help everyone keep their focus on legislative matters,\u201d he added.\n\nGiving legislators a pretense to investigate the clothing choices of college girls to make sure they're \u201cmodest\u201d enough certainly sounds more fun than boring stuff like adopting a code of ethics and just generally remembering that it's never a good idea for grown men, especially those who hold themselves out as moral arbiters for the rest of us, to start messing with college girls. But, as some Democratic joy-killers were quick to point out, it's a bad look to blame girls for having such hot sexy bodies instead of expecting grown men to behave with a modicum of dignity and common sense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really not going to require interns to dress so we\u2019re less distracted, are we?\u201d Democratic Rep. Bill Otto messaged. \u201cAll we need is a code of ethics and a penalty provision.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri intern handbook already has a general dress code requiring interns to wear \u201cappropriate business attire,\u201d which is defined as \u201ca jacket and necktie\u201d for men and \u201cdress, suit, dress slacks and jacket\u201d for women.\n\nClaire McCaskill, a Democrat who represents Missouri in the U.S. Senate, got wind of what was going on and sent out a letter to legislators that reads, \u201cThis problem has nothing to do with how interns are dressed.\u201d She continues, \u201cI refuse to stand by idly while any suggestion is made that victims of sexual harassment in the Missouri State Legislature is the responsibility of anyone other than the legislators themselves.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22b04235215b082e43e"}}
