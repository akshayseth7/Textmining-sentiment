An effective vaccine will be another very important tool for both current and future Ebola outbreaks.\"\n\nMore research is needed, but the results so far on this trial show 100% efficacy.\n\nIt will take weeks at the least, and possibly a couple of months, for more supply to be made, according to Chan.\n\nResearchers have been using a \"ring\" strategy -- based on that used in smallpox eradication in the 1970s -- to test the vaccine's effectiveness.\n\n\"The premise is that by vaccinating all people who have come into contact with an infected person you create a protective 'ring' and stop the virus from spreading further,\" said John-Arne Rottingen of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, which has been involved in implementing the trial.\n\nRelatives, co-workers, health workers get jab\n\nTo date, more than 4,000 close contacts of almost 100 Ebola patients, including family members, neighbors and co-workers, have voluntarily participated in the trial, the WHO statement said.\n\nUntil this week, half were vaccinated three weeks after the identification of an infected patient and others straight away, to allow for comparison of the results. The randomization was stopped on Sunday \"to allow for all people at risk to receive the vaccine immediately, and to minimize the time necessary to gather more conclusive evidence needed for eventual licensure of the product,\" the WHO said.\n\nThe trial will now include 13- to 17-year-olds, and possibly children from age 6, on the basis of new evidence of the vaccine's safety, it added.\n\nJUST WATCHED WHO: New Ebola vaccine 'highly effective' Replay More Videos ...

Goodman, professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, said the results published in The Lancet provided \"exciting preliminary evidence\" that the vaccine is likely to be effective but also cautioned that further analysis was needed.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the degree of protection reported seems convincing,\" he said.\n\nThe concerted effort to find a vaccine reflects the severity of the crisis presented by Ebola, spread through contact with body fluids from an infected person or contaminated objects from infected persons.

At the time, though, officials warned outbreaks in Guinea and Sierra Leone ran the risk of bringing the virus back to Liberia, where more than 4,000 people died after contracting it.\n\nAll 33 contacts in Liberia who have been followed up since the latest infections there are two days from completing the 21-day period to be declared free of the disease.\n\n9 things to know about Ebola", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf08c04235215b082e30e"}}
