Foster and William R. Hawk\n\nGovernment means-tested assistance programs, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), provide cash and noncash benefits to many low-income families. In 2009, 19.0 percent of U.S. families, on average, participated in at least one major means-tested program per month. Participation rates were highest for one-parent families headed by women, 46.3 percent, compared with 26.5 percent for one-parent families headed by men and 12.3 percent for married-couple families.1\n\nThis article uses data from the 2011 Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey to examine the spending patterns of families receiving benefits from one or more government means-tested assistance programs.2 Families with children under 18 are the focus of this research, because the poverty rate for children under 18 was highest for this group, at 21.9 percent in 2011, compared with 13.7 percent for people age 18 to 64 and 8.7 percent for people age 65 and older.3\n\nFindings show that:\n\nAverage total expenditures of families receiving means-tested assistance were less than half those of families not receiving assistance.\n\nFor families receiving assistance, food, housing, and transportation accounted for 77.0 percent of the family budget, compared with 65.5 percent of the budget of families not receiving assistance.\n\nAmong one-parent families receiving assistance, 36.8 percent did not own a car, compared with 3.0 percent of families not receiving assistance and 9.7 percent of two-parent families receiving assistance.\n\nScope of analysis\n\nThe sample used in this analysis consisted of families with at least one child under 18.4 Families receiving assistance were compared with families not receiving assistance; demographic characteristics, as well as spending patterns, were examined.\n\nAdditional analysis of families receiving assistance was made by comparing single-parent and dual-parent families.\n\nThe benefit programs in which sample families participated include housing assistance (provision of public housing and housing subsidy payments); Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that pays for medical care for low-income persons; and public assistance (cash assistance from state and local government welfare programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and short-term emergency help). Also included are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the SSI program that provides monthly benefits to disabled adults and children, and to those 65 and older who have limited income and assets but are not disabled. Participation in any of these programs is determined by information provided by survey respondents.\n\nFindings\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all findings are statistically significant.\n\nDemographic characteristics\n\nConsumer Expenditure Survey (CE) data show that in 2011,5 there were 27.1 million families in the United States with at least one child under 18 years old.6 About 24 percent of families with children under 18 received government means-tested assistance benefits. Among families receiving assistance, 51.6 percent were one-parent families, and 48.4 percent were two-parent families. Average family size was the same (3.7 persons), whether or not a family received assistance. Among families receiving assistance, however, one-parent families averaged 3.1 persons, compared with 4.4 for two-parent families. (See table 1.)\n\nTable 1.

This proportion ranged from 55.8 percent of one-parent families receiving assistance to 90.8 percent of families not receiving assistance. Nearly 14 percent of all families had a reference person who was Black or African-American. This proportion ranged from 9.2 percent of families not receiving assistance to 44.2 percent of one-parent families receiving assistance.

This proportion ranged from 6.1 percent of families not receiving assistance to 31.9 percent of two-parent families receiving assistance. In families not receiving assistance, 43.4 percent had a reference person with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, compared with 7.4 percent of one-parent families and 11.1 percent of two-parent families receiving assistance.

The situation was reversed among families receiving assistance, with 26.5 percent homeowners and 73.5 percent renters. Two-parent families receiving assistance were more likely (36.5 percent) to be homeowners than one-parent families (17.1 percent).\n\nParticipation in means-tested assistance programs\n\nAmong families receiving government means-tested assistance, Medicaid was the program with the highest participation rate (69.7 percent). (See table 2.)8\n\nTable 2. Families receiving means-tested government assistance, by participation in selected programs and annual benefit amount received, 2011 Program Percent of families participating in program Average annual amount received by participating families All One-parent Two-parent All One-parent Two-parent Housing assistance 25.9 41.1 9.6 NA NA NA Medicaid 69.7 68.2 71.3 NA NA NA Public assistance 10.7 15.7 5.1 2,713 2,666 2,867 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 60.9 72.2 48.9 2,702 2,758 2,615 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 12.5 14.2 10.7 6,994 5,998 8,402\n\nSNAP benefits were reported by 60.9 percent of families receiving assistance. A greater proportion of one-parent families received SNAP benefits (72.2 percent, compared with 48.9 percent of two-parent families). For families with SNAP benefits, the average amount received was $2,702; one-parent families received an average of $2,758, not statistically different from the $2,615 received by two-parent families.9\n\nNearly 26 percent of families received housing assistance; one-parent families had a participation rate of 41 percent, compared with almost 10 percent for two-parent families.10\n\nA small proportion (12.5 percent) of families received SSI benefits. One-parent families received SSI benefits averaging $5,998, not statistically different from the $8,402 received by two-parent families.11\n\nPublic Assistance had the lowest participation rate (10.7 percent), and the average benefit received was $2,713. Participation, however, was 15.7 percent for one-parent families, compared with 5.1 percent for two-parent families. Benefits averaged $2,666 for one-parent families and $2,867 for two-parent families, but these differences were not statistically significant.12\n\nSpending patterns\n\nIn 2011, total expenditures were more than twice as high for families not receiving assistance, $66,525, compared with $30,582 for families receiving assistance. Total expenditures for one-parent families receiving assistance were $24,780, roughly two-thirds of the $36,756 spent by two-parent families receiving assistance. Food, housing, and transportation accounted for the greatest proportion of the budget of all families. These three categories made up 65.5 percent of the total budget of families not receiving assistance, compared with 79.7 percent for one-parent and 75 percent for two-parent families receiving assistance. (See table 3.)\n\nTable 3. Average annual expenditures, families with children under 18, by receipt of means-tested government assistance, 2011 Item All Families receiving Type of family receiving assistance No assistance Assistance One-parent Two-parent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Total expenditures $57,760 100.0 $66,525 100.0 $30,582 100.0 $24,780 100.0 $36,756 100.0 Food 8,788 15.2 9,539 14.3 6,460 21.1 5,709 23.0 7,259 19.7 Food at home 6,183 10.7 6,470 9.7 5,293 17.3 4,810 19.4 5,806 15.8 Food away from home 2,605 4.5 3,069 4.6 1,167 3.8 899 3.6 1,453 4.0 Housing 20,151 34.9 22,833 34.3 11,835 38.7 10,343 41.7 13,423 36.5 Apparel and services 1,505 2.6 1,628 2.4 1,123 3.7 1,009 4.1 1,245 3.4 Transportation 9,791 17.0 11,249 16.9 5,271 17.2 3,734 15.1 6,906 18.8 Healthcare 3,001 5.2 3,687 5.5 876 2.9 487 2.0 1,290 3.5 Entertainment 2,917 5.1 3,423 5.1 1,347 4.4 1,108 4.5 1,601 4.4 Personal insurance and pensions 7,354 12.7 9,116 13.7 1,890 6.2 1,011 4.1 2,826 7.7 Other 4,251 7.4 5,048 7.6 1,780 5.8 1,378 5.6 2,207 6.0\n\nHousing expenditures were almost twice as high among families not receiving assistance ($22,833, compared with $11,835 for families receiving assistance). One factor affecting the difference in expenditures is the higher homeownership rate among families not receiving assistance. Another factor is the provision of public housing or housing subsidy payments for 26 percent of families receiving assistance. Although greater in dollar amount, housing expenditures represented a smaller share of total expenditures among families not receiving assistance (34.3 percent, compared with 38.7 percent for families receiving assistance).\n\nFood expenditures were higher among families not receiving assistance, but accounted for a lower share of total expenditures than among families receiving assistance. A different pattern emerges when separately examining food at home and food away from home, the two components of food spending. Food away from home spending was higher in both dollar amount and percent of total spending among families not receiving assistance. One explanation is the prevalence of SNAP benefits, which can only be used for food at home, among families receiving assistance.13\n\nTransportation expenses, both in dollars ($3,734) and as a percentage of the family budget (15.1 percent) were lowest among one-parent families receiving assistance. A major factor is the lower rate of automobile ownership among one-parent families. Almost 37 percent did not own a car, compared with almost 10 percent of two-parent families receiving assistance and 3 percent of families not receiving assistance. Transportation expenses were $11,249 for families not receiving assistance, but represented a smaller share of the family budget (16.9 percent) than the $6,906 spent by two-parent families, which accounted for 18.8 percent of the family budget.\n\nAlthough clothing is a basic necessity, it claimed a relatively small proportion of the family budget of all families, ranging from 2.4 percent for families not receiving assistance to 4 percent for one-parent families receiving assistance.14\n\nHealthcare was greatest in dollar amount ($3,728) and as a proportion (5.5 percent) of the budget of families not receiving assistance. Among families receiving assistance, healthcare spending averaged $487 (2.0 percent of the family budget) for one-parent and $1,290 (3.5 percent of the family budget) for two-parent families. One explanation is the fact that 70 percent of these families had Medicaid coverage for healthcare expenses. The data, however, do not indicate whether, all factors being equal, families with Medicaid benefits received the same services and quality of care as either families receiving no assistance or families receiving assistance other than Medicaid.\n\nPersonal insurance and pensions accounted for 13.7 percent of the budget of families not receiving assistance, compared with 6.2 percent for families receiving assistance. Families receiving assistance had fewer earners and so would be less likely to make pension contributions than families without assistance who had more earners.\n\nEntertainment expenses were 5.1 percent ($3,423) of the budget of families not receiving assistance, compared with 4.4 percent ($1,347) of families receiving assistance. Other expenses15 claimed 7.6 percent of the budget of families not receiving assistance and 5.8 percent of the budget of those receiving assistance.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough average family size was the same, average annual expenditures of families receiving assistance were less than half the amount spent by families not receiving assistance.\n\nFood, housing, and transportation took up the greatest share of the family budget, regardless of whether any assistance was received. Families not receiving assistance spent more on food and on housing than families receiving assistance, but expenditures represented smaller proportions of the family budget, compared with families receiving assistance.\n\nHealthcare spending was highest in dollar amount and as a percentage of the family budget among families receiving no assistance. One reason is that 70 percent of families receiving assistance had Medicaid coverage.\n\nUpcoming articles Export Price Indexes\n\nYour medical plan choices: What's in a name?\n\nAccess to dependent care reimbursement accounts and workplace-funded childcare\n\nThis Beyond the Numbers article was prepared by Ann C.
