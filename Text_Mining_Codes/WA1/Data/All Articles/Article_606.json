For over a decade, he\u2019s been, to my reckoning, not just the most prolific mashup creator, but the absolute best at it. Vidler is possessed of an extraordinary gift for finding transcendence in what can too often be a very gimmicky, punchline-y form.\n\nThis month he\u2019s released a new EP (free for download, as there\u2019s really no way to sell stuff like this without a licensing nightmare) called \u201cSleazy Egyptian.\u201d It\u2019s a hodgepode that features collisions between the Bangles and the Stranglers, Basement Jaxx and the Beatles, and Daft Punk, Chic, and Mousse T. But the standout\u2014and the track most likely of interest to DM readers\u2014is this rather amazing union of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That Peculiar \u201d and the Ramones\u2019 \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop .\u201d\n\n\n\nPreviously on Dangerous Minds:\n\n\u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 vs \u2018Norwegian Wood:\u2019 the world\u2019s first mashup, 1968\n\nMashup: Velvet Underground / Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell - \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d / \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain\u201d\n\nBunnymen vs White Stripes, Bee Gees vs Killing Joke and more: New mashups from Go Home Productions\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf15204235215b082e3b4"}}
