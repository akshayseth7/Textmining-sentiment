Mali had only seven of the world\u2019s 542 confirmed cases in 2012, but three of them were detected in Niger among refugees from Mali, which suggests that the disease is spreading. \u201cWe have no good sense of what the real case count is,\u201d Dr. Ruiz-Tiben said. In 2006, he said, one infected student walked 250 miles north to the northern Kidal region of Mali and started an outbreak that spread worms to at least 400 others.\n\nPolio, the other disease that along with Guinea worm is closest to eradication, has also received an unfortunate assist from political violence.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0ed04235215b082e37e"}}
