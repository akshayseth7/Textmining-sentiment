His latest EP, Sleazy Egyptian, is a typically deft collection, and perhaps the standout track is a Marvin Gaye-Ramones pairing called \u201cPeculiar Bop.\u201d\n\nThe song grafts the punk melody of \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop\u201d onto the Motown backing of \u201cAin\u2019t That Peculiar,\u201d and the result is a seamless, surprisingly catchy blending of genres. As usual, Vidler avoids the gimmick of mere juxtaposition, creating a tune that legitimately stands on its own.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef1f04235215b082e23c"}}
