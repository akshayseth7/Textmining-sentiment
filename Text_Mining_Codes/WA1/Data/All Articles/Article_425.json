That particular search just got a lot easier\u2014and a lot classier\u2014thanks to Meow Met, a new Chrome extension. Designed by Emily McAllister for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Media Lab, Meow Met shows you a cat-related picture from the museum\u2019s collection every time you open up a new tab. As Hyperallergic\u2019s Claire Voon writes, the extension makes ordinary browser usage \u201cinto an enjoyable learning experience.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, Meow Met offers an important reminder that our contemporary passion for depictions of our feline friends has deep historical origins. Most of the pictures it presents derive from the 19th century, but a few are much, much older. Those of more recent provenance vary delightfully in style and approach, from a charming Qing dynasty scroll of a cat pawing at butterflies to a more sinister oil painting by Gwen John.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs Voon notes, the extension doesn\u2019t resize the artworks to fit within the browser window. It does, however, crop them in a way that almost always spotlights the cat (or cats! or kittens!), ensuring that users never come away from a new tab disappointed. What\u2019s more, clicking on the work\u2019s title pulls up its entry in the Met\u2019s digital catalog, offering a fuller view for those unsatisfied with adorable fragments.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf07904235215b082e300"}}
