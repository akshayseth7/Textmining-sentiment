But it looks like director Todd Strauss-Schulson may have found a new twist for the meta-horror formula, judging from the trailer for The Final Girls.\n\nTaissa Farmiga stars as a teenager who, along with a group of friends, is supernaturally drawn inside a 1980s cult classic slasher movie starring her dead mother (Malin Akerman). Since they already know the plot of the movie, the teens have to figure out a way to escape alive. With plenty of jokes about bad writing, fake blood, and the fact that \u201ceveryone who has sex in this movie dies,\u201d The Final Girls aims to please cinephiles and \u201980s nostalgists. Debuting at SXSW earlier this year, The Final Girls got fairly positive reviews, with Variety\u2019s Dennis Harvey calling it \u201cgood fun that should delight genre fans\u201d with \u201can accessible in-joke.\u201d The Final Girls will have a limited release in theaters and hit video on demand in October.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf30804235215b082e47d"}}
