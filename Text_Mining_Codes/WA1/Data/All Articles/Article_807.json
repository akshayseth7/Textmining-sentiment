Dre was reportedly angry about a Pump It Up! segment hosted by Barnes that aired in November 1990. The report focused on N.W.A., and concluded with a clip of Ice Cube, who had recently left the group, insulting his former colleagues. Soon after the attack, Barnes described it in interviews: She said Dre attempted to throw her down a flight of stairs, slammed her head against a wall, kicked her, and stomped on her fingers. Dre later told Rolling Stone, \u201cIt ain\u2019t no big thing \u2013 I just threw her through a door.\u201d He pleaded no contest to assault charges. Barnes\u2019s civil suit against Dre was settled out of court.\n\nBarnes agreed to watch F. Gary Gray\u2019s just-released film about N.W.A, Straight Outta Compton, and reflect on it for Gawker.\n\nI never experienced police harassment until I moved to California in the \u201880s. The first time it happened, I had just left a house party that erupted in gunfire. A cop pulled me over and ordered me out of the car. I was 19, naive, and barefoot. When I made a move to get my shoes, the cop became aggressive. He manhandled me because he supposedly thought I was grabbing for a weapon. I\u2019m lucky he didn\u2019t shoot me. There I was, face down on the ground, knee in my back. In June, I was reminded of what happened to me when I watched video of a police officer named Eric Casebolt grabbing a 15-year-old girl outside the Craig Ranch North Community Pool in Texas, slamming her body to the ground, and putting his knee in her back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree years later\u2014in 1991\u2014I would experience something similar, only this time I was on my back and the knee was in my chest. That knee did not belong to a police officer, but Andre Young, the producer/rapper who goes by Dr. Dre. When I saw the footage of California Highway Patrol officer Daniel Andrew straddling and viciously punching Marlene Pinnock in broad daylight on the side of a busy freeway last year, I cringed. That must have been how it looked as Dr. Dre straddled me and beat me mercilessly on the floor of the women\u2019s restroom at the Po Na Na Souk nightclub in 1991.\n\nThat event isn\u2019t depicted in Straight Outta Compton, but I don\u2019t think it should have been, either. The truth is too ugly for a general audience. I didn\u2019t want to see a depiction of me getting beat up, just like I didn\u2019t want to see a depiction of Dre beating up Michel\u2019le, his one-time girlfriend who recently summed up their relationship this way: \u201cI was just a quiet girlfriend who got beat on and told to sit down and shut up.\u201d\n\nBut what should have been addressed is that it occurred. When I was sitting there in the theater, and the movie\u2019s timeline skipped by my attack without a glance, I was like, \u201cUhhh, what happened?\u201d Like many of the women that knew and worked with N.W.A., I found myself a casualty of Straight Outta Compton\u2019s revisionist history.\n\nDre, who executive produced the movie along with his former groupmate Ice Cube, should have owned up to the time he punched his labelmate Tairrie B twice at a Grammys party in 1990. He should have owned up to the black eyes and scars he gave to his collaborator Michel\u2019le. And he should have owned up to what he did to me. That\u2019s reality. That\u2019s reality rap. In his lyrics, Dre made hyperbolic claims about all these heinous things he did to women. But then he went out and actually violated women. Straight Outta Compton would have you believe that he didn\u2019t really do that. It doesn\u2019t add up. It\u2019s like Ice Cube saying, \u201cI\u2019m not calling all women bitches,\u201d which is a position he maintains even today at age 46. If you listen to the lyrics of \u201cA Bitch Iz a Bitch,\u201d Cube says, \u201cNow the title bitch don\u2019t apply to all women / But all women have a little bitch in \u2018em.\u201d So which is it? You can\u2019t have it both ways. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do with Straight Outta Compton: They\u2019re trying to stay hard, and look like good guys.\n\nI knew the guys of N.W.A. years before they blew up. I first met Andre (who\u2019s wonderfully portrayed by Corey Hawkins in Compton) when he lived with his cousin Jinx, who would later introduce me to O\u2019Shea Jackson, a.k.a. Ice Cube. I was at Lonzo\u2019s house when Andre and Antoine Carraby, a.k.a. Yella, were both still in the World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru. I was there at the radio station KDAY with Greg Mack. Later, while they were creating the N.W.A and the Posse album, I would meet MC Ren and Arabian Prince. It was at Lonzo\u2019s studio that my best friend Rose Hutchinson and I formed the rap group Body and Soul. We spent countless days and nights at Lonzo\u2019s house, and in his studio we recorded a demo produced by both Dr. Dre and DJ Pooh. It was there where I also met Eric Wright, a.k.a. Eazy E. These men became my brothers.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in the studio to hear them record their disgusting, misogynistic views on women in songs like \u201cA Bitch Iz a Bitch,\u201d \u201cFindum, Fuckum & Flee,\u201d \u201cOne Less Bitch,\u201d and perhaps most offensively, \u201cShe Swallowed It.\u201d (On that track, MC Ren brags about violating at 14-year-old girl: \u201cOh shit it\u2019s the preacher\u2019s daughter! / And she\u2019s only 14 and a ho / But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro.\u201d) I heard the material like everybody else, when I was listening to the albums, and I was shocked. Maybe that was their point. Maybe they said a lot of that stuff for the shock value. There were always other girls around, like Michel\u2019le and Rose, and we never heard them talk like that. We never heard them say, \u201cBitch, get over here and suck my dick.\u201d In their minds, only certain women were \u201clike that,\u201d and I\u2019ve never presented myself like that, so I never gave them a reason to call me names.\n\nAccurately articulating the frustrations of young black men being constantly harassed by the cops is at Straight Outta Compton\u2019s activistic core. There is a direct connection between the oppression of black men and the violence perpetrated by black men against black women. It is a cycle of victimization and reenactment of violence that is rooted in racism and perpetuated by patriarchy. If the breadth of N.W.A.\u2019s lyrical subject matter was guided by a certain logic, though, it was clearly a caustic logic.\n\nIt was so caustic that when Dre was trying to choke me on the floor of the women\u2019s room in Po Na Na Souk, a thought flashed through my head: \u201cOh my god. He\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d He had me trapped in that bathroom; he held the door closed with his leg. It was surreal. \u201cIs this happening?\u201d I thought.\n\nTheir minds were so ignorant back then, claiming that I set them up and made them look stupid. That wasn\u2019t a setup. It was journalism and television, first of all, and secondly, I had nothing to do with the decision to run the package as it did. After an interview with N.W.A., the segment ended with Ice Cube saying \u201cI got all you suckers 100 miles and runnin\u2019,\u201d and then, imitating N.W.A. affiliate the D.O.C.: \u201cI\u2019d like to give a shoutout to the D.O.C. Y\u2019all can\u2019t play me.\u201d I was a pawn in the game. I was in it, but so was a true opportunist: the director of Straight Outta Compton, F. Gary Gray.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right. F. Gary Gray, the man whose film made $60 million last weekend as it erased my attack from history, was also behind the camera to film the moment that launched that very attack. He was my cameraman for Pump It Up! You may have noticed that Gary has been reluctant to address N.W.A.\u2019s misogyny and Dre\u2019s attack on me in interviews. I think a huge reason that Gary doesn\u2019t want to address it is because then he\u2019d have to explain his part in history. He\u2019s obviously uncomfortable for a reason.\n\nGary was the one holding the camera during that fateful interview with Ice Cube, which was filmed on the set of Boyz N the Hood. I was there to interview the rapper Yo Yo. Cube was in a great mood, even though he was about to shoot and he was getting into character.\n\nCube went into a trailer to talk to Gary and Pump It Up! producer Jeff Shore. I saw as he exited that Cube\u2019s mood had changed. Either they told him something or showed him the N.W.A. footage we had shot a few weeks earlier. What ended up airing was squeaky clean compared to the raw footage. N.W.A. were chewing Cube up and spitting him out. I was trying to do a serious interview and they were just clowning\u2014talking shit, cursing. It was crazy.\n\nRight after we shot a now-angry Cube and they shouted, \u201cCut!\u201d one of the producers said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put that in.\u201d I said, \u201cHell no.\u201d I wasn\u2019t even thinking about being attacked at the time, I was just afraid that they were going to shoot each other. I didn\u2019t want to be part of that. \u201cThis is no laughing matter,\u201d I tried telling them. \u201cThis is no joke. These guys take this stuff seriously.\u201d I was told by executives that I was being emotional. That\u2019s because I\u2019m a woman. They would have never told a man that. They would have taken him seriously and listened.\n\nIt was that interview that was the supposed cause of Dre\u2019s attack on me, as many of his groupmates attested. My life changed that night. I suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack. I love Dre\u2019s song \u201cKeep Their Heads Ringin\u201d\u2014it has a particularly deep meaning to me. When I get migraines, my head does ring and it hurts, exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall. People have accused me of holding onto the past; I\u2019m not holding onto the past. I have a souvenir that I never wanted. The past holds onto me.\n\nPeople ask me, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not on TV anymore?\u201d and \u201cHow come you\u2019re not back on television?\u201d It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t tried. I was blacklisted. Nobody wants to work with me. They don\u2019t want to affect their relationship with Dre. I\u2019ve been told directly and indirectly, \u201cI can\u2019t work with you.\u201d I auditioned for the part that eventually went to Kimberly Elise in Set It Off. Gary was the director. This was long after Pump it Up!, and I nailed the audition. Gary came out and said, \u201cI can\u2019t give you the part.\u201d I asked him why, and he said, \u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m casting Dre as Black Sam.\u201d My heart didn\u2019t sink, I didn\u2019t get emotional; I was just numb.\n\nMost recently, I tried to get a job at Revolt. I\u2019ve known Sean (Combs) for years and have the utmost respect for him. Still nothing. Instead of doing journalism, I\u2019ve had a series of 9-5 jobs over the years to make ends meet.\n\nThere\u2019s a myth that I was paid so well by the settlement I received from Dre that I\u2019d never have to work again. People think I was paid millions, when in reality, I didn\u2019t even get a million, and it wasn\u2019t until September of 1993. He and his lawyers dragged their feet the whole way. He stopped coming to court, they kept postponing it. I was tired, and, toward the end, pregnant, but I still tried to show up for everything. And I never thought I was going to have to stop doing what I loved for my job. That was the furthest thing from my mind.\n\nThe last time I saw Dre, and was up close and personal with him, we were cordial but not friendly. That was years ago, before \u201cGuilty Conscience,\u201d the 1999 Eminem/Dre collaboration that references me (\u201cYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?\u201d). I most recently saw Cube at the Kings of the Mic show at Los Angeles\u2019s Greek Theater in 2013. We talked briefly and he was very unfriendly. Standoffish, even.\n\nThere were two things that made me emotional while watching Straight Outta Compton. The first was the scene where D.O.C. is in the hospital after a car accident that nearly decapitated him. I went to see him then, and I was devastated. I thought he was going to die. I saw him fresh, when he was hooked up to life support and had blood and cuts still visible.\n\nThe other scene was Eazy\u2019s death. I got a chance to see him prior to his dying of AIDS-related complications in March of 1995, maybe about a month before. I briefly owned a production company. Our office was on Melrose, and we shared it with another production company. Eazy came in to the other production company to look for a director for a Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony video. I didn\u2019t know he was coming, he didn\u2019t know I was going to be there. It was just a pure blessing. I am so grateful I had the opportunity to make peace with him before he passed. We hugged, we kissed, we talked, and I felt good when I saw him, but I knew something was wrong. He didn\u2019t look well. I thought maybe he just had a cold. He wasn\u2019t coughing, the way it was dramatized in the movie. He sounded congested and he looked skinny. We had a nice conversation and I felt really good about it.\n\nI believe that if Eazy were alive, neither Tairrie B., nor JJ Fad wouldn\u2019t have been ignored in the movie. Eazy was the straight shooter of the group and he just would have kept it more real. JJ Fad was a trio of female rappers from Rialto, California, whose debut album was released by Ruthless in order to establish and legitimize the label. It was commercially successful and featured the mega hit \u201cSupersonic,\u201d produced by Arabian Prince, who appears only briefly in Straight Outta Compton. JJ Fad\u2019s success paved the way for the release of the Straight Outta Compton album. It\u2019s a very pivotal moment that was erased from N.W.A.\u2019s story. It\u2019s easy for them to be dismissive of women, because they don\u2019t respect most women.\n\nWith the exception of short scenes with mother figures and wives, the rest of the women in the film were naked in a hotel room or dancing in the background at the wild pool parties. Yo Yo, a female rapper who worked with Ice Cube after he left N.W.A., was nowhere to be found. Nor are women who worked with Dre later in his career, like Jewell and the Lady of Rage. They both contributed tremendously to the ultimate sound of the classic album The Chronic. What about Ruthless R&B singer-song-writer Michel\u2019le, who at the young age of 17 was singing vocals on World Class Wreckin Cru\u2019s \u201cTurn Off The Lights\u201d? Michel\u2019le and Dr. Dre developed a personal and professional association and he went on to produce her two best-known hits, \u201cNo More Lies\u201d and \u201cSomething In My Heart.\u201d Both songs reflected their volatile relationship. Then there is Ruthless Records/Comptown Records solo female artist/Eazy E\u2019s protege Tairrie B, the first white female hardcore rapper. A bold blonde at the time who wasn\u2019t afraid to speak her mind, Tairrie B released an album named The Power Of A Woman (how fitting!) and dropped singles like \u201cMurder She Wrote\u201d and \u201cRuthless Bitch.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, at a Grammys party in front of an A-List crowd, Dr. Dre assaulted Tairrie B. This was a year before my assault. In an interview, F. Gary Gray said these were considered \u201cside stories\u201d and not important to the narrative.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s too bad for the movie and it\u2019s too bad for its audience. Straight Outta Compton transforms N.W.A. from the world\u2019s most dangerous rap group to the world\u2019s most diluted rap group. In rap, authenticity matters, and gangsta rap has always pushed boundaries beyond what\u2019s comfortable with hardcore rhymes that are supposed to present accounts of the street\u2019s harsh realities (though N.W.A. shared plenty of fantasies, as well). The biggest problem with Straight Outta Compton is that it ignores several of N.W.A.\u2019s own harsh realities. That\u2019s not gangsta, it\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s just business. Try as they might, too much of N.W.A.\u2019s story ain\u2019t that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug.
