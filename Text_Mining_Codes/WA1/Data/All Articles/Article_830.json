An identical sculpture was donated by the artist\u2019s wife to a Bavarian school. Photo: Uwe Anspach/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nMUNICH\u2014Half a century ago, a German sculptor\u2019s widow and an elite Bavarian boarding school agreed on a novel way to cover her son\u2019s tuition: She donated a bronze horse that her husband had made for Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe 10-foot-tall horse still stands in the school\u2019s courtyard, unremarked until early this month, when a Munich newspaper wrote about it. The revelation has sparked a battle between the Schloss Ising boarding school and local politicians, historians and Jewish leaders, who say the horse is an affront to Holocaust victims.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s in front of a school is bizarre,\u201d says Jan M\u00fchlstein, chairman of Munich\u2019s Beth Shalom Congregation, who says the school should remove it or at least add an explanatory plaque. \u201cDo we really want kids cavorting and playing around a prancing Nazi horse?\u201d\n\nThe Bavarian Association of Boarding Schools, which manages the school, said it has long been aware of the statue\u2019s provenance and has no plans to change the status quo.\n\n\u201cIt is our school\u2019s statue,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe can choose what to do with it.\u201d\n\nThe dispute is the latest challenge for this Bavarian capital as it wrestles with its Nazi-era history. During Hitler\u2019s rise, Munich and Bavaria\u2014a south German region that borders his native Austria\u2014were hotbeds for his party.\n\n\u201cNo other province profited so much as Bavaria from Nazi rule,\u201d says Stephan Klingen, a senior researcher at Munich\u2019s Central Institute for Art History, itself housed in a Nazi administration building designed by one of the party\u2019s star architects, Paul Troost. \u201cThe Nazi party members here were the wealthy ones; they supported the economy before and after the war.\u201d\n\nToday, neo-Nazis play next to no role in Bavarian politics\u2014especially when compared with the former Communist East Germany, where the far-right NPD holds seats in one state legislature. But reminders remain.\n\nBavaria has been embroiled in the controversy surrounding Cornelius Gurlitt , the son of Hitler\u2019s art dealer. The state confiscated a trove of 1,300 artworks belonging to Mr. Gurlitt in 2012 during a tax investigation. But the find\u2014including pieces that had been looted from Jews\u2014only came to light in 2013 when a German magazine revealed its existence.\n\nOutside of the home of Mr. Gurlitt, who died in May 2014, a statue honoring Nazi playwright Artur Kutscher still stands.\n\nMr. Kutscher mentored the famous German playwright Bertolt Brecht. In 1933, Kutscher joined the Nazi literary organization and Mr. Brecht fled to Prague after the Nazis labeled him \u201ca cultural Bolshevist.\u201d Mr. Kutscher was fired from his university post when the Allies occupied Munich but in 1968 the city erected the memorial.\n\nGavriel Rosenfeld, a historian of Nazi and Judaic cultures at Fairfield University in Connecticut, is among those who believe plaques should be added to such statutes to explain the Nazi connection.\n\n\u201cMunich has made improvements in remembering its past in terms of research steps,\u201d namely opening the Nazi-Era Document Center in April, he said. \u201cBut in these instances they\u2019re trying to downplay their place and whitewash the issues.\u201d\n\nBenno Graf, the mayor of Chieming, the village outside Munich where the Schloss Ising school is located, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the city of Munich also declined to comment.\n\nThe school said that the statue\u2019s history had been addressed in a report the school\u2019s history department wrote in 2008.\n\nJosef Thorak, the sculptor, was on Hitler\u2019s \u201cF\u00fchrer List\u201d of lauded artists. Mr. Thorak had praised Hitler\u2019s censorship of \u201cdegenerate\u201d artists, writing in 1934 that \u201c[I] believe in this F\u00fchrer, who has harmoniously fulfilled our ardent wishes.\u201d He regularly enjoyed tea with Hitler\u2019s friends including Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who wrote in his diary that he and Hitler viewed Mr. Thorak as \u201cour strongest sculpting genius.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorak created three identical stallions in the 1930s to symbolize the advent of the Third Reich. Two of the horses were painted in gold and placed in front of Hitler\u2019s chancellery in Berlin. They ended up on a Soviet military base in East Germany but disappeared after German unification. They were seized during raids in May by authorities investigating the black-market sale of art connected to the Third Reich.\n\nThe third horse was featured in Hitler\u2019s Great German Art exhibition in 1939. It was Mr. Thorak\u2019s third wife, whom he married after denouncing his Jewish second wife, who donated it to the school in 1961.\n\nThe conservative Christian Social Union, which has governed Bavaria since 1957 and is the sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s Christian Democrats, supports adding a plaque.\n\n\u201cIt would be a sensible, simple solution to have a plaque enlightening viewers about the statue\u2019s history and that it exemplifies the type of bellicose art Hitler loved,\u201d said Karl Freller, the CSU\u2019s deputy floor leader in the state legislature.\n\nRobert Singer, chief executive of the World Jewish Congress, said a plaque was \u201cthe very least\u201d the school should do. \u201cThese artifacts have become symbols of the Nazi regime\u2019s aggressiveness and expansionism,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Mary M.
