(According to CNN, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Indianapolis has confirmed \u201cHerman\u2019s information was part of the federal investigation into the former pitchman.\u201d)\n\nShe\u2019s since detailed her involvement, claiming she wore a wire over a five year period and recorded conversations where he allegedly talked about having sex with children. He also, allegedly, asked her repeatedly to let him install hidden cameras in her kids\u2019 rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had two young children at the time, and he talked to me about installing hidden cameras in their rooms and asked me if I would choose which child I would like him to watch,\u201d she told Inside Edition Thursday.http://gawker.com/reporter-says-...\n\nBut apparently the FBI wasn\u2019t the only entity to whom she reported Fogle\u2019s inappropriate behavior. Herman-Walrond tells Gawker that Subway knew or should have known there were issues with their spokesperson\u2014because she tried to warn Subway\u2019s corporate office in 2009.\n\nShe says she\u2019s not sure of the exact date and doesn\u2019t have a copy of the email because she sent it through a comment form on Subway\u2019s corporate website. But she\u2019s certain she detailed disturbing comments made by Fogle, and she\u2019s certain she never heard back.\n\n\u201cI told them how Jared had approached my children\u2014that I met him during my radio show program\u2014and that he had approached my children and had made sexual comments about wanting to do things with my children and their friends,\u201d Herman-Walrond said. \u201cI never got a \u2018Thank you for emailing\u2019 or anything like that, but I sent it and it did go through.\u201d\n\nSubway has not responded to requests for comment.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daefda04235215b082e271"}}
