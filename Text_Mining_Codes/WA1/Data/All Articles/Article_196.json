According to Amelia Phillips, the Harvard women\u2019s captain, \u201cIt\u2019s a world-class facility, and I would add the horses here are all incredible.\u201d\n\nThe polo club\u2019s Louis XV-inspired style and unabashed embrace of all things nouveau riche invokes thoughts of China\u2019s countless instances of \u201ccopycat\u201d architecture that tend to be more style than substance, such as a \u201cminiature Paris\u201d complete with an Eiffel Tower on the outskirts of Hangzhou and a British-inspired \u201cThames Town\u201d near Shanghai. The level of extreme luxury it offers, however, appears to be the real deal, with a wine cellar stocking bottles of Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, and Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem, and polo horses (and trainers) flown in from New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina.\n\nThe club is the brainchild of well-known billionaire Pan Sutong of the Hong Kong real estate and financial conglomerate Goldin Group\u2014the sole company building the business district. Known for his passion for wine and horses, the magnate\u2019s company sponsors an annual charity polo tournament in England that counts Princes Harry and William among its participants. He has previously told Bloomberg that he\u2019s \u201cnot satisfied with three Michelin stars or Robert Parker\u2019s 100 points\u201d at his high-end properties. As one of the world\u2019s biggest Bordeaux collectors, Pan recently launched a wine and luxury lifestyle magazine called Le Pan based in Hong Kong, and has expressed plans to use Tianjin\u2019s free-trade zone to house a massive warehouse for imported wine.\n\nStarting on July 21, the tournament functioned as a showcase not only for the relatively unknown sport, but also for the elite connections it could bring. Considered the \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d of a 20,000-square-kilometer central business district development called Goldin Metropolitan that\u2019s under construction in Tianjin, the ultra-exclusive 890,000-square-meter polo club spares no expense. In addition to three international standard polo fields and more than 200 horses, the club features palatial European-style, marble-floored buildings housing a luxury hotel, 16 restaurants featuring French, Japanese, and Chinese cuisine, a \u201cwine museum\u201d with more than 10,000 bottles, a spa, a pool, a cigar bar, a gym, British butlers who are \u201cfully conversant with royal etiquette and protocol,\u201d according to the Financial Times , and a chandelier-filled banquet space.\n\nThis match took place less than three weeks before the massive chemical explosions that shook the city earlier this month. The elite university polo teams gathered in the city\u2019s new economic development zone to participate in an intercollegiate tournament at the Tianjin Goldin Metropolitan Polo Club, which is located about 40 miles away from the Binhai New Area where the blast occurred. The club is part of a gigantic real estate development aimed at raising Tianjin\u2019s profile and becoming a key center for China\u2019s ultrarich to work and play\u2014if the city can convince them to settle there.\n\nLin, who started learning equestrian skills when he was 5 years old, isn\u2019t at one of the 100-plus-year-old polo clubs in England or the United States, but on the outskirts of Tianjin at a 5-year-old polo club, China\u2019s largest. As one of the club\u2019s star young players, his photo adorns the club\u2019s marketing materials urging well-heeled parents to sign their kids up for lessons.\n\nTIANJIN, China\u2014Thirteen-year-old polo player Arthur Lin sits in a private viewing suite watching the polo teams of Oxford and the University of London square off in the championship round of a weeklong tournament between the world\u2019s most elite universities. Although Yale has come in dead last for the week, behind Cambridge, Harvard, and Stanford, Lin\u2019s father still sees the Ivy League university as the best destination for his son, joking that Arthur will hopefully help raise the profile of the school\u2019s team when he\u2019s on it five years from now.\n\nEach Friday, Roads & Kingdoms and Slate publish a new dispatch from around the globe.

Lawrence attends Syracuse University in the United States, while Arthur is entering ninth grade at a local international school in Tianjin. \u201cI feel so excited when I watch him play,\u201d Lin says of Arthur, noting the importance of both sports and schoolwork for getting into a top university. \u201cChinese families put so much attention and finance toward the next generation,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto courtesy Liz Flora/Jing Daily\n\nThe prospect of admission to top-tier international universities is one of the main factors attracting China\u2019s next generation\u2014and their parents\u2014to the training and equipment-intensive sport. According to Arthur, \u201cWhen my dad told me to play polo, I wasn\u2019t very convinced, but now that I\u2019ve been playing it for a while, I really enjoy the sport.\u201d\n\nPolo \u201ccould not be as popular as golf because with golf, anybody with clubs can begin to play, but to ride, there\u2019s a barrier,\u201d says William Lin. \u201cBut I think as the Chinese economy is going up, more people will join this game.\u201d\n\nWhile members may be enticed by the luxurious amenities and opportunities for their kids, the polo club\u2019s main purpose is to get China\u2019s wealthy interested in Fortune Heights, a collection of over 1,600 multimillion-dollar residential units under construction surrounding the fields that will be finished later this year. As part of one of the only combined polo and real estate developments in the world, the properties range from luxury apartment buildings to European-style villas with their own tennis courts. Apartments cost between $1 million and $5 million, while the most expensive villas top $90 million. While polo club memberships start at $165,000 for nonresidents, those who purchase property get automatic membership.\n\nPhoto courtesy Liz Flora/Jing Daily\n\nThe marketing materials for the development exhort potential residents to \u201cbecome a part of the new nobility\u201d and \u201ctake your place amongst the elite,\u201d while Pan\u2019s motto for the development is the Chinese phrase qian jin mai wu, wan jin mai li, which roughly translates to \u201ca quality house is worth a thousand pounds of gold, but quality neighbors are worth 10 thousand.\u201d\n\nThis is the goal not just for the polo club, but for the entire new development. Located about a half-hour\u2019s drive from the center of Tianjin, Goldin Metropolitan is the world\u2019s largest development to be undertaken by a single corporation at once. Slated for completion in 2016, the area includes office buildings, a \u201csix-star\u201d hotel, an international school, a convention center, shopping malls, Broadway-style theaters, and a 117-story tower called Goldin Finance 117, which is set to become the ninth-tallest building in the world.\n\nThe future success of Goldin\u2019s mega-investment relies not only on China\u2019s continued economic growth, but on demand among China\u2019s wealthy to settle down in Tianjin. So far, 20 percent of the first phase of the Fortune Heights residential units have been sold, and the company says it is adopting a \u201cmoderate\u201d approach to releasing the homes for sale as construction nears completion.\n\nThe properties are going on the market at a time when China is awash with luxury \u201cghost towns\u201d due to either speculative buying or overconstruction. Another Tianjin satellite, Jing Jin City, features 4,000 European-style villas, a Hyatt Regency hotel, a golf course, and a horse-racing track, but few residents.\n\nPhoto courtesy Liz Flora/Jing Daily\n\nFor the new area and polo club to form the elite community that Goldin envisions, China is going to have to convince its ultrarich to stay in the country at a time when many of those who can afford it want to leave. A recent Barclays survey found that almost half of all of China\u2019s rich plan to move abroad within the next five years to countries like the United States, Canada, or Australia, where they believe they can find better educational opportunities, economic conditions, and health care. For those who can afford luxury real estate, a growing number are opting to buy properties in cities like Vancouver, Sydney, Los Angeles, and New York thanks to both the desire to relocate and fears of a Chinese real estate bubble at home.\n\nAnother main issue for them is safety of the environment around them, including clean air, water, and food\u2014which many have little faith that the government can ensure anytime soon. The disastrous chemical explosion that rocked Binhai is not likely to calm those concerns, as Tianjin residents now fear exposure to toxic chemicals and question why companies were allowed to keep dangerous chemicals close to residential areas. Some experts are now even saying that it was the Chinese government\u2019s overzealous efforts to develop the free-trade zone that helped lead to the explosion, as it led to a \u201cdistorted\u201d overreliance on petrochemical industries with little oversight and development of disaster prevention plans.\n\nIn Goldin\u2019s case, the company is hoping that the lure of the lifestyle offered by the development and the polo club can overcome these issues and turn Tianjin into the next Shanghai. William Lin, who owns property 30 minutes away from the club, is planning to buy one of its apartments once both of his kids have left for college. When asked whether he believes it\u2019s a good investment, he said, \u201cI think it could be,\u201d and \u201cthe idea is correct.\u201d According to Lin, \u201cIf it\u2019s successful, we\u2019ll have a very good place to play polo and also make Tianjin\u2019s profile quite big.\u201d The question is now whether enough of his peers will join him\u2014and if his sons and their jet-setting, polo-playing generation will be willing to move back to China after Oxford and Yale.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeefa04235215b082e21a"}}
