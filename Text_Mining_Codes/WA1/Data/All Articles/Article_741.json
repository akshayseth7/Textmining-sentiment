Last year, the music company that Dr. Dre helped establish, Beats, was sold to Apple for $3 billion, making him the self-proclaimed \u201cfirst billionaire in hip-hop.\u201d\n\nBut critics charge that the movie, which was co-produced by Dr. Dre, glosses over N.W.A.\u2019s record of misogyny and ignores Dr. Dre\u2019s history of physically abusing women. In a sign that the uproar was threatening not only his reputation but also his business dealings, Dr. Dre, who has previously spoken dismissively or vaguely about the decades-old episodes, confronted them on Friday in a statement to The New York Times. While he did not address each allegation individually, he said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I\u2019ve been married for 19 years and every day I\u2019m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I\u2019m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe added: \u201cI apologize to the women I\u2019ve hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.\u201d\n\nApple, where Dr. Dre, 50, now works as a top consultant, also issued a statement: \u201cDre has apologized for the mistakes he\u2019s made in the past and he\u2019s said that he\u2019s not the same person that he was 25 years ago. We believe his sincerity and after working with him for a year and a half, we have every reason to believe that he has changed.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest case of a celebrity who, partly because of the Internet, has been forced to face old abuse allegations. And for the accusers, Dr. Dre\u2019s statement may be an acknowledgment of what they said decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn interviews with The Times this week, the women at the center of the allegations \u2014 the hip-hop journalist Dee Barnes; Michel\u2019le, an R&B singer and Dr. Dre\u2019s former girlfriend; and Tairrie B, a onetime labelmate \u2014 spoke about the abuse and about how social media had helped them connect and spread their stories.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking about my abuse for many, many years, but it has not gotten any ears until now,\u201d said Michel\u2019le, who was romantically involved with Dr. Dre from the late-\u201980s until the mid-\u201990s. (They have an adult son.)\n\nDuring that time, she said, he was often physically abusive, hitting her with a closed fist and leaving \u201cblack eyes, a cracked rib and scars.\u201d Michel\u2019le said she never pressed charges because, \u201cWe don\u2019t get that kind of education in my culture.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cOpening up and finding out there were other women like me gave me the power to speak up.\u201d\n\nTairrie B, a.k.a Tairrie B. Murphy, said that Dr. Dre punched her twice in the face at a Grammys after-party in 1990 after she recorded a track insulting him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe connected with Ms. Barnes through Facebook last year. \u201cI said, \u2018Hey girl, I think we have something in common, and we\u2019ve never talked about it,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Murphy said.\n\nMs. Barnes recalled being brought to tears by that message and a subsequent hourslong phone conversation with Ms. Murphy. Both women were writing memoirs \u2014 Ms. Barnes\u2019s is tentatively titled \u201cMusic, Myth and Misogyny\u201d \u2014 but did not expect to wage a public campaign against Dr. Dre, she said.\n\n\u201cThe initial conversation was like group therapy, to heal our wounds,\u201d Ms. Barnes said.\n\nAs the Aug. 14 release of \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d approached, others started the discussion. A blog post from last year by the rap writer Byron Crawford, titled \u201cBeatings by Dre,\u201d began to circulate again on Twitter and Facebook, while a Gawker post headlined \u201cRemember When Dr. Dre Bashed a Female Journalist\u2019s Face Against a Wall?\u201d was published on July 31 and was viewed nearly 300,000 times. (In format, it mirrored a Gawker article from early 2014: \u201cWho Wants to Remember Bill Cosby\u2019s Multiple Sex-Assault Accusations?\u201d)\n\nAt a panel for \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d this month, the film\u2019s director, F. Gary Gray, was asked why the film omitted Ms. Barnes\u2019s story, in which Dr. Dre confronted her at a party in 1991 about an N.W.A. segment on her Fox show \u201cPump It Up!\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement Ms. Barnes issued at the time, Dr. Dre began punching her in the head and \u201cslamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall.\u201d (Charged with assault and battery, he pleaded no contest. He was sentenced to community service and probation, fined $2,500 and ordered to make a domestic violence P.S.A.; a civil suit was settled out of court.)\n\nMr. Gray said at the panel that the filmmakers had \u201ctalked about it at the beginning\u201d \u2014 the scene appeared in an early script \u2014 but ultimately decided the movie \u201cwasn\u2019t about a lot of side stories.\u201d He added, \u201cYou can make five different N.W.A. movies \u2014 we made the one we wanted to make.\u201d (Through Universal Studios, Mr. Gray declined to comment.)\n\nSensing the renewed interest, Ms. Murphy encouraged Ms. Barnes to tell her side. \u201cIt\u2019s about finally getting the truth out there,\u201d Ms. Murphy said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Barnes published an essay on Gawker about the film and her assault that was seen more than 1.6 million times. \u201cI suffer from horrific migraines that started only after the attack,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy head does ring and it hurts, exactly in the same spot every time where he smashed my head against the wall.\u201d\n\nShe called the movie \u201crevisionist history,\u201d lamenting the women, including Ms. Murphy and Michel\u2019le, who were written out. The movie \u201cwasn\u2019t reality and it wasn\u2019t gangster,\u201d Ms. Barnes said. \u201cGangster would have been to show everything.\u201d\n\nAs a white, female rapper signed to Ruthless Records, N.W.A.\u2019s record label, Ms. Murphy said she had been expected to collaborate with Dr. Dre, but resisted his creative control. \u201cHe was very nasty to me constantly,\u201d she said, and so she decided to address his chauvinism on the song \u201cRuthless Bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Dr. Dre said at a crowded party that he\u2019d heard the track, the pair began arguing. \u201cI stood up to him, and I didn\u2019t back down,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018If you say one more word to me ...\u201d Then, she said, \u201che punched me right in the mouth and again in the eye.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Murphy did not file a police report \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse, but this was a different time,\u201d she said \u2014 a meeting was scheduled the next day with Eazy-E, a founder of N.W.A., and Jerry Heller, N.W.A.\u2019s manager and a founder of Ruthless. \u201cI was told, \u2018This is a family business \u2014 you\u2019re not pressing charges,\u201d she said. \u201cI was taken care of by Eazy in certain ways to be quiet.\u201d (Mr. Heller did not respond to requests for comment. Eazy-E died in 1995.)\n\nAfter Ms. Murphy reconnected with Ms. Barnes, \u201cI had a lot of guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cHad I pressed charges, he would have had a strike against him. And maybe Michel\u2019le would have stood up, too. Maybe it would have made him think.\u201d\n\nSince the attack, Ms. Barnes said that she has had trouble finding work in the entertainment industry: \u201cHis career continued, where mine dwindled. People side with the money.\u201d\n\nStill, she rejects those who say coming forward again now is opportunistic. \u201cWhat opportunity?\u201d she said. \u201cShow me the opportunities.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThey brought up the past\u201d by making the film. \u201cNot me.\u201d\n\nMichel\u2019le agreed. \u201cThey told their story,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m telling mine.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22904235215b082e43c"}}
