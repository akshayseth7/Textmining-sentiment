It\u2019s a large-scale luxury development that stopped, left to weather and dissolve along with its brochure promises of an \u201cideal life\u201d in the \u201csuper garden with the area of thousand square metres\u201d [sic]. That\u2019s a rough translation from Chinese of the equally obscene opulence of this gated community trapped, along with its employees, in a limbo of incompletion. That\u2019s where artist Andi Schmied and collaborator Lawrence Lek came across Jing Jin City in January last year, a development an hour outside of Beijing that boasts a five-star hotel, 3,000 villas and hardly any occupants.\n\nThe outcome of this shared visit in summer was a return by Schmied eight months later in the winter and the Jing Jin City book to follow \u2013with its collection of haunting photos of unfinished mansions, collapsed advertising billboards, bricks and stone sculptures \u2013published in January 2015. It\u2019s a part of an ongoing project relating to the fated venture that still stands zombie-like and half inhabited by its employees as it slowly dissolves.\n\n\u201cA stage set of an abandoned future\u201d is what Schmied evocatively calls this new terrain in writing written in vignettes, glimpses into the lives and landscapes that make up a Jing Jin City that\u2019s been emptied of its original intention and repurposed into this Utopian no-place that \u201cresists authorship\u201d. Except that it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s just that the authors of this new world are not the property developers and their postcards promising \u201cthe caress of the Hot Spring\u201d and \u201can atmosphere of international business opportunity\u201d (\u201ceverybody is having a great time\u201d). Instead it\u2019s the people left behind \u2013gardeners, builders, guards, caretakers \u2013that now populate the vast grounds of Jing Jin City and become a part of Schmied\u2019s narrative drawn from observations and occasional conversations with the workers themselves via Baidu Online Translation.\n\n\u201cIt is more exciting when the colleagues have their bikes in the south car park,\u201d says a security guard in the opening chapter titled \u2018On the Absence of Use\u2019. It\u2019s one of three that detail the breathtaking decay and slow cycle of change across seasons in analogue photographs of lonely golden statues, frozen moats and empty, unfitted buildings. Mostly presented in matte, the images show up in glossy pages for chapter II titled \u2018On the Sense of Ownership\u2019 with its installations by Lek and Schmied presented on the concrete floors and staircases of these uninhabited mansions. It\u2019s like a catalogue that comes accompanied by materials descriptions like, \u201c23 groups of counter balanced glass window panes\u201d.\n\n\u201cConstructions fell, materials weathered, vegetation grew\u201d, Schmied writes about her return to Jing Jin City in the winter, as she notes the worker\u2019s sense of boredom and sleeping patterns become attuned to the sunlight because there\u2019s no electricity. The pages in the book aren\u2019t numbered, in the same way that time as we know it no longer exists. **\n\nMore photos, top right.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02804235215b082e2bd"}}
