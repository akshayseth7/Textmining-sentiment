The girls tricked their jihadist suitors into sending them money online on the false premise that they planned to use the funds to move to Syria to marry ISIS fighters. However, once these \u201cjihadist brides\u201d received the money, they shut down their online profiles, only to reappear a short time later to scam another ISIS recruiter out of his ill-gotten cash.\n\nWhile the authorities generally don\u2019t want to condone the work of Internet scam artists, these Chechen teenagers have highlighted a real vulnerability in ISIS\u2019s ability to attract recruits to its cause\u2014one that can be turned against the group for a fraction of the price of the bombs the United States is dropping from warplanes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nUnlike what\u2019s often portrayed in the media, there are relatively few people who decide on their own to move to Syria to join ISIS. Typically, there\u2019s a middleman\u2014a recruiter on social media or a neighborhood friend already on the battlefield\u2014who persuades, cajoles, and pressures the fence-sitters to make their way to the so-called caliphate. These men (and women) play a critical role in bringing fresh foreign fighters into Syria as well as keeping the ISIS war machine running.\n\nISIS has a finite number of possible recruiters who are skilled at their craft.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Rukmini Callimachi recently profiled one lonely young woman in Washington who almost fell into ISIS\u2019s clutches, lured by a middle-age man in England who she met online and who sent her money and gifts in the mail. The same was true of an Orange County, California, man who \u201csuccumbed,\u201d as one U.S. attorney put it, to ISIS\u2019s online efforts. Or the three teenagers from Colorado who almost made it to Syria last year courtesy of an online ISIS recruiter.\n\nFor the government to try to stop every possible recruit from joining ISIS is a fool\u2019s errand; there are simply too many people who could potentially join the group. In a recent case in Mississippi where a couple was publicly casting about on social media to figure out how to get to Syria, the FBI\u2019s efforts seemed like a labor-intensive way to bust a pair of low-level, nonviolent suspects. Rather, it\u2019s on the other side of this equation\u2014targeting the recruiters\u2014where intelligence services, law enforcement, and even private individuals could dramatically raise the cost of doing business for ISIS.\n\nSince many ISIS wannabes interact with charismatic online middlemen\u2014even just to discuss the logistics of getting to Syria\u2014the governments of the world could overwhelm ISIS\u2019s recruiting system by creating hundreds of fake ISIS-curious individuals to interact with recruiters.\n\nFor starters, one can safely assume that ISIS has a finite number of possible recruiters who are successful at their craft. An ISIS fighter who only speaks Arabic, for instance, will not be able to persuade an English-speaker in the United States, especially over a period of weeks or months. And even if a person has the requisite language skills, it doesn\u2019t mean he has the sophistication to convince someone to journey to Syria to fight and die for Islamist marauders.\n\nThus, wasting their time and scamming them for cash is a good first step to imposing a high price on recruiters\u2019 activities\u2014at a low cost. The recruiters are, after all, human, and thus may not have the necessary mental bandwidth to deal with dozens of fakes. And just like there\u2019s an online community that scams Nigerian scam artists, there would be a large group of private citizens willing to confuse and harass ISIS recruiters in their spare time.\n\nThat\u2019s Step 1. Step 2 is for the government to collect enough intelligence on these top recruiters to create profiles for targeting purposes. The best recruiters are crafty and sophisticated enough to not give away too much personal data on the Internet. However, enough information, combined with intelligence and law enforcement data, can eventually be combined to block their activities or arrest them if they live in the West or other friendly countries. And if they\u2019re in Syria, perhaps enough intelligence can be gathered to put them out of business using more deadly means.\n\nLaw enforcement has a great deal of experience performing these stings. The FBI already uses similar online operations to bust pedophiles both in the United States and internationally. Law enforcement should have little trouble setting up multiple fake personas in order to lure ISIS recruiters.\n\nOther nations can assist in this effort to undermine these recruiting networks. Counterterrorism is a team sport. European and Middle Eastern nations, as well as Russia and China, can help overwhelm ISIS\u2019s human networks\u2014and they will know how to best tailor their messages to dupe local-language recruiters. Liberating ISIS\u2019s money will also provide some light into how funds move across national borders and perhaps which financial institutions are assisting in these efforts.\n\nSoon, the usual, deep-seated paranoia coursing through these kinds of organizations will surface, perhaps dissuading ISIS handlers from interacting with genuine recruits. The governments of the world will thus be turning ISIS\u2019s asymmetric social media efforts against itself.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22104235215b082e438"}}
