They contacted the Australian Twin Registry, a database of 40,000 twins who are willing to take part in health- or medical-based research, and found six sets of identical twins of various ethnicities, age ranges and genders.\n\nThe facial recognition software requires a RealSense camera from Intel. It comprises three different cameras: infra-red, regular and 3D. The software then combines these into a single image that can judge depth, heat and photos to decide whether the user matches.\n\nEach set of twins set up an account for one and then the other attempted to log-in \u2014 and the software held. According to The Australian, there was not one instance of Windows Hello allowing the wrong twin access to the computer.\n\nWith all of the recent attacks on user privacy and security, having another option to log-in is starting to become essential. Microsoft claim that in order for a hacker to steal your biometrics data they need to steal your entire PC which is quite a distance from a Russian hacker posting 1.2 billion passwords onto the Internet.\n\nWindows Hello is available to all those who have Windows 10 who also has a compatible camera.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1d004235215b082e415"}}
