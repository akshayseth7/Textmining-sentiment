As I wrote Wednesday, this program has become more popular in recent years, especially among graduate students, thanks to the Obama administration's efforts to promote it. The new edition will be open to anybody who has taken out loans directly from the government, including older debtors who previously didn't qualify, and includes a few reforms meant to better aim the benefits at needier borrowers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne of those tweaks is designed to make sure married couples pay their fair share by requiring them to hand over 10 percent of their combined discretionary income, which the government defines as any earnings over 150 percent of the poverty line. As the Center for American Progress explains, it's meant to close a bit of a \u201cloophole\u201d in the current system:\n\nUnder other plans, married borrowers can file individually, thus capturing only one income while claiming their spouse when reporting their household size. This substantially reduces the monthly payment amount on the individual\u2019s loan. REPAYE would eliminate this loophole by basing monthly payments on combined income and household size\u2014a more accurate measure of an individual\u2019s ability to repay their loans.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf10e04235215b082e39b"}}
