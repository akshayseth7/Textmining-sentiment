The protests, which reportedly escalated when people started throwing rocks and bottles at officers, led the St. Louis Police Department to respond with a regrettably familiar show of military-style force, complete with armored vehicles, riot gear, tear gas, and smoke canisters.\n\nLeon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer.\n\nOne aspect of the police\u2019s response was distinctly unfamiliar, though. According to local black newspaper the St. Louis American, around 8 p.m. a line of police officers began \u201cmoving towards the crowd and started beating their batons on the ground\u201d in unison. The paper reported that as the officers \u201cadvanced down the street,\u201d the synchronous taps \u201cseemed to further enrage the individuals who had temporarily formed pockets on the side street.\u201d According to the paper, demonstrators seemed to take \u201cthe batons hitting the ground as taunts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe situation got worse from there, with protesters setting fire to a mattress, an American flag, and a car, which was still smoldering the following morning. Ultimately the night ended with nine people arrested, and many community members outraged over what they saw as an excessive use of force by the police.\n\nSo what was the eerie-sounding baton-thumping tactic that police used on Wednesday evening? How was it meant to work, and what was it supposed to accomplish?\n\nNone of the experts on crowd control I reached on Thursday could give me a name for what the maneuver is called. They did recognize it, however, and told me that it dates back as far as the 1960s, though it is not often used today, at least not in the United States. (I reached out to the St. Louis Police Department for comment but did not hear back. I will update this post if I get a response.)\n\n\u201cWhile this is somewhat common in Europe, it is pretty rare in [the] US,\u201d wrote Alex Vitale, a sociologist at Brooklyn College who has studied police tactics for crowd control. \u201cThe idea is a kind of \u2018shock and awe\u2019 effect. It represents a concrete threat that the police are prepared to use force to disperse people. On the one hand it is an organized, measured, and intentional show of force. On the other hand it can be very provocative, inviting additional throwing of rocks and bottles.\u201d\n\nIrv Miller, president of J & L Self Defense Products, a company that sells batons and other equipment to law enforcement agencies, confirmed that the point of the tactic is essentially to scare protesters. \u201cIn riot control training they are taught that the unison and teamwork of the group is intimidating,\u201d Miller wrote in an email. It is meant, he added, \u201cto psychologically affect the people creating the disturbance.\u201d\n\nJoseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD officer, echoed that explanation: \u201cThink of the Roman soldiers banging on their shields to instill fear in the opponent,\u201d he wrote to me. \u201cIt's all about a psychological advantage.\u201d\n\nBut how can a tactic that is now uncommon, and somewhat inscrutable, send a clear message? According to Doug Wyllie, editor in chief of the law enforcement news and commentary website PoliceOne, that\u2019s sort of the point. \u201cIt really is just a matter of doing something that\u2019s completely nonviolent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intent is to get people to think, \u2018This is gonna get weird in a minute.\u2019 \u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeebb04235215b082e1e7"}}
