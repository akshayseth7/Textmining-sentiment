They suggested categorizing it on the spectrum with OCD. They had examined 42 patients who self-referred with misophonia, and found a consistent syndrome: Specific sounds triggered an aggressive response and socially isolating coping mechanisms. Schr\u00f6der told me that almost half of these patients also met the criteria for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\n\nIntriguingly, Wu also found that misophonia symptoms tracked with symptoms of the psychiatric conditions anxiety , depression , and obsessive-compulsive disorder . I could understand people feeling anxious and depressed because of misophonia. But I was surprised by the connection to OCD, an anxiety disorder involving intrusive thoughts and the overwhelming need to soothe them with coping behaviors. However, Wu\u2019s study wasn\u2019t the first to suggest a connection between mental illness and misophonia.\n\nWu and her colleagues found that a full 20 percent of the students reported what the researchers considered clinically significant misophonia symptoms. The Florida students with significant symptoms had \u201cthis extreme reaction to really selective sound stimuli,\u201d says Wu\u2014stimuli like the mouthy noises described in Edelstein\u2019s study. They also used similar coping mechanisms. Sadly, half of those with clinical symptoms\u2014about 10 percent of all the students\u2014reported that they had significant trouble functioning at school and work. That high of a number surprised me at first, but then again, I can totally understand why people don\u2019t talk about what feels like a crazy, aggressive overreaction to lip-smacking (urgh).\n\nOne team has examined how common misophonia is in a general population . In 2014, clinical psychology doctoral student Monica Wu, psychologist Eric Storch , and their colleagues at the University of South Florida surveyed 483 undergraduate students about misophonia symptoms.* That\u2019s not to say that these 483 students perfectly represented the world: Almost 60 percent were white, more than 80 percent were women, and 100 percent were participating in the study to get extra credit for their psych classes.\n\nThe strong distaste for \u201cchewing, mouthy sounds\u201d and coping mechanisms sounded eerily familiar to me, although my coping strategies weren\u2019t seriously affecting me. But this study only looked at 11 self-selected volunteers. What about misophonia among the rest of us?\n\nThe volunteers knew their aggressive reactions were inappropriate and outsized. They told Edelstein how they\u2019d developed coping mechanisms, such as leaving the room, avoiding certain situations, using headphones, and even mimicking their trigger sounds to mask the noise. Some of these coping mechanisms negatively affected their work and home lives.\n\nBut when Edelstein and her colleagues interviewed 11 volunteers from the support group, they were struck by the common patterns. Each volunteer reacted intensely to what Edelstein describes as \u201cchewing, mouthy sounds\u201d made by adults. When she exposed people with and without misophonia to trigger sounds like loud chewing, sniffing, and lip-smacking (urgh), both sets of people reacted negatively. The people with misophonia just reacted more\u2014indicating, perhaps, that misophonia might just be at the extreme end of a normal distribution. Perhaps the people with misophonia had unusually strong neural connections between sound-processing parts of their brains and their limbic systems, which help regulate emotion.\n\nOne of the few labs that have published on the subject is run by author , TED talker , and neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran . When people from an Internet support group for misophonia first contacted the lab, \u201cwe were kind of skeptical,\u201d says doctoral student Miren Edelstein of the University of California, San Diego. \u201cNobody had heard of this disorder\u201d back in 2011, and people often asked to have their unusual ailments studied by Ramachandran.\n\nI started at PubMed, the massive database of peer-reviewed scientific articles maintained by the National Library of Medicine. But compared to the hundred thousand hits I got for searching on major depression disorder , a search for misophonia pulled up only 26 articles . Most were published in the past few years.\n\nAnd my third reaction was: Wait. I\u2019m a science writer and a scientist. So I\u2019ll do the (moderately) rational thing: corner some scientists who study misophonia and ask them some questions. Like, what do we know about misophonia? Can we treat it? And should we actually be calling it a disorder, on par with major depression and bipolar disorders?\n\nWhen I first read a description of misophonia, my reaction was: Other people have this?! This intense, angry reaction to everyday sounds like chewing, lip-smacking, sniffing, and pen-clicking\u2014sounds that other people can ignore?\n\nNot necessarily. Wu has reservations about prescribing medication before we know more. But when it comes to therapy, she has some qualified hope. Her team reported successfully treating two young patients using cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014a well-established form of psychotherapy that helps patients recognize distressing thoughts and develop healthier behaviors in response to those thoughts.\n\nHowever, not all misophonia researchers agree that misophonia should be regarded as a psychiatric condition.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201cextreme, inaccurate, and improper approach\u201d to treat misophonia as a psychiatric disorder like OCD, says Emory University otolaryngology professor Pawel Jastreboff. He and his collaborator and spouse, Margaret Jastreboff, coined the term misophonia in 2001. They argue that misophonia is a form of decreased sound tolerance. He says they have seen hundreds of misophonia patients and that very, very few had any sort of psychiatric condition. Indeed, Jastreboff believes that the Dutch psychiatrists incorrectly linked misophonia to OCD because, he says, they were studying \u201cpsychiatric patients to start with, and some of them have misophonia.\u201d\n\nThe Jastreboffs propose that misophonia is actually a learned response. They suggest that people with misophonia have learned to associate a negative reaction to something they originally considered just annoying\u2014such as the culturally inappropriate sounds of bad table manners. Based on this idea, the Jastreboffs have been treating patients with a form of desensitization therapy. In this therapy, the person with misophonia is gradually retrained to associate positive experiences with formerly negative triggers\u2014for example, by smelling and eating delicious cookies while in the presence of a noisy eater.\n\n\u201cMisophonia definitely can be treated successfully,\u201d says Pawel Jastreboff, \u201cbut it is important to know how to do it.\u201d In 2014, the Jastreboffs reported that 152 out of 184 misophonia patients\u201483 percent\u2014had significant improvement after going through the desensitization therapy.\n\nI still had reservations after I read their paper. Their study was observational, instead of the gold standard: the randomized control trial. All of the Jastreboffs\u2019 patients were treated with the same therapy, so we can\u2019t compare their improvement with what might happen naturally over time in untreated people or what would happen in people treated with other therapies. Plus, the study seemed ripe for a placebo effect because the scientists were asking people to self-report how they\u2019re doing when they knew they\u2019d just gone through months of desensitization therapy.\n\nNot to say that Pawel Jastreboff is unaware of these limitations. \u201cIt would be a good idea\u201d to evaluate therapies through controlled trials, he says, adding that \u201csomebody hopefully will do that in the future.\u201d For now, the Jastreboffs are both stymied by the \u201cten million dollars\u201d he says it would take.\n\nTo be honest, this debate about the treatments and nature of misophonia didn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s a pretty new disorder, and not much research has been done on it. When there\u2019s still so much uncertainty in the tiny community of misophonia researchers, is it actually helpful to refer to misophonia as its own separate disorder?\n\nThe scientists studying misophonia believe so, because of the terrible effects they see in their patients. The University of Amsterdam\u2019s Schr\u00f6der says that his patients \u201cexperience severe symptoms and frequently cannot function anymore.\u201d They can\u2019t eat dinner with their families, work effectively in big offices, or live happily with their spouses. Wu also sees significant impairment among kids with misophonia. In a previous case she worked on, the young patient couldn\u2019t go to school and couldn\u2019t even talk with the child\u2019s mother, who made trigger sounds. And Edelstein reported that at least one of the 11 volunteers she interviewed had contemplated suicide.\n\nIn his 2013 study, Schr\u00f6der and his colleagues wrote that they were proposing diagnostic criteria and psychiatric classification to \u201cimprove recognition by health carers and encourage scientific research\u201d into misophonia. Getting misophonia recognized in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as some researchers are advocating, would certainly help in other ways, including the practical. \u201cIt helps with insurance,\u201d says Wu. Furthermore, naming and identifying a disabling behavior as misophonia, she says, \u201cdoes help in terms of giving it a face\u201d and legitimacy to skeptical family and friends.\n\nSo what\u2019s an Internet-self-diagnosed misophonic with a healthy dose of skepticism supposed to do?\n\nPersonally, as someone who doesn\u2019t have much impairment beyond the occasional spike of extreme irritation, I plan to wait out the years of scientific discussion and debate. But after hearing about patients who are isolated, depressed, and even contemplating suicide, I definitely want to say this: There is help out there for people who are suffering and need someone to talk with.\n\nAnd I hope that knowing about misophonia helps others who didn\u2019t know there are other people who really can\u2019t stand chewing, sniffing, and lip-smacking (urgh).", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee3504235215b082e186"}}
