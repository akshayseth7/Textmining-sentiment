This, in part, is the inspiration behind \u201c\u00a1Cuba, Cuba!,\u201d an International Center of Photography exhibit at the Southampton Arts Center in New York of more than 100 photographs, historic artifacts, political posters, and publications spanning the past 65 years of Cuban history.\n\nThe exhibit, curated by Cuban art historian Iliana Cepero and ICP curator Pauline Vermare, features a unique collection of works by more than 20 Cuban photographers, including Alberto Korda, (who shot the now-iconic image of Che Guevara), Ra\u00fal Corrales, Marucha (Mar\u00eda Eugenia Haya), and legendary American photographers like Burt Glinn and Elliott Erwitt.\n\n\u201cThe images are like a map of Cuba, a cartography of feelings, ideas, mentalities,\u201d Cepero said. \u201cThat is the intellectual and emotional complexity of Cuba.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Mar\u00eda Magdalena Campos-Pons / Lehigh University Art Galleries\u2014MuseumOperation.\n\nCourtesy of Tony Mendoza / Lehigh University Art Galleries\u2014MuseumOperation\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith recent renewed interest from Westerners, particularly Americans, to visit Cuba \u201cbefore it changes,\u201d the exhibit aims to open up a dialogue between myth and reality, to create interest in Cuba\u2019s artistic and cultural production, and to expose the public to different artists and images than the ones they\u2019ve already seen\u2014the ossified images from the first days of the revolution.\n\nCourtesy of Burt Glinn / Magnum Photos\n\n\u201cThat phrase, \u2018before Cuba changes\u2019 really bothers us,\u201d Cepero explained. \u201cThe myth is beautiful; being trapped inside it isn\u2019t.\u201d The exhibit wants to challenge those myths and let everyday Cuban reality speak for itself by asking questions. How are people dealing with scarcity? Why is the paint peeling, why are these old cars here? It\u2019s not an aesthetic choice; they\u2019re there precisely because there is no choice.\n\nCourtesy of Gilda Perez/Lehigh University Art Galleries\u2014MuseumOperation\n\n\u201cTo visit a country because it\u2019s \u2018frozen in time\u2019 is to glorify poverty,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about foreigners who want a tropical refuge made in the image and likeness of the fantasy they have of Cuba, while refusing to see the people living inside that fantasy. The exhibit aims to let Cubans tell their own story and history, and tell a different history of photography and a different history of their country.\u201d\n\nUnidentified photographer/Courtesy of International Center of Photography\n\nCourtesy of Gory (Rogelio L\u00f3pez Marin)/Lehigh University Art Galleries\u2014MuseumOperation\n\nBoth groups of photographers, the Americans and the Cubans, helped build the myths that inform today\u2019s reality and today\u2019s images. The revolution looks different under an American like Glinn\u2019s lens compared to a Cuban like Korda\u2019s. Glinn showed what happened during the first weeks: chaos, confusion, looting and destruction. Cuban photographers came later, when the revolution was already in place, to tell stories of triumph that aimed to portray Cuba\u2019s place in history.\n\nUnidentified photographer/Courtesy of ICP\n\nCuba\u2019s isolation has shaped the lives of its citizens, and its photographers are a reflection of that. Cuban photographers were a select group that shared tips through word of mouth, including where to get developing materials and new photography techniques. \u201cCuban photographers can\u2019t have big egos,\u201d Cepero said. \u201cYou have to be solidary to survive, be humble.\u201d As a result Cuba\u2019s photography as a whole has a visual unity and uniformity photography from other countries lacks.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Cuba, Cuba!\u201d doesn\u2019t shy away from exploring the myth of the island. The exhibit builds on it to tell the story of Cuba as a country, as a world on to itself, with light and shadows, and all the complexity that entails.\n\nCourtesy of Mario D\u00edaz", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02204235215b082e2b7"}}
