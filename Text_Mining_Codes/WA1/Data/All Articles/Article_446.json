When he ran for president in 1976, many of Reagan\u2019s anecdotes converged on a single point: The welfare state is broken, and I\u2019m the man to fix it. On the trail, the Republican candidate told a tale about a fancy public housing complex with a gym and a swimming pool. There was also someone in California, he\u2019d explain incredulously, who supported herself with food stamps while learning the art of witchcraft. And in stump speech after stump speech, Reagan regaled his supporters with the story of an Illinois woman whose feats of deception were too amazing to be believed.\n\n\u201cIn Chicago, they found a woman who holds the record,\u201d the former California governor declared at a campaign rally in January 1976. \u201cShe used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans\u2019 benefits for four nonexistent deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare. Her tax-free cash income alone has been running $150,000 a year.\u201d As soon as he quoted that dollar amount, the crowd gasped.\n\nFour decades later, Reagan\u2019s soliloquies on welfare fraud are often remembered as shameless demagoguery. Many accounts report that Reagan coined the term \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d and that this woman in Chicago was a fictional character. In 2007, the New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman wrote that \u201cthe bogus story of the Cadillac-driving welfare queen [was] a gross exaggeration of a minor case of welfare fraud.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews says the whole thing is racist malarkey\u2014a coded reference to black indolence and criminality designed to appeal to working-class whites.\n\nJosh Levin Josh Levin is Slate's executive editor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThough Reagan was known to stretch the truth, he did not invent that woman in Chicago. Her name was Linda Taylor, and it was the Chicago Tribune, not the GOP politician, who dubbed her the \u201cwelfare queen.\u201d It was the Tribune, too, that lavished attention on Taylor\u2019s jewelry, furs, and Cadillac\u2014all of which were real.\n\nAs of 1976, Taylor had yet to be convicted of anything. She was facing charges that she\u2019d bilked the government out of $8,000 using four aliases. When the welfare queen stood trial the next year, reporters packed the courtroom. Rather than try to win sympathy, Taylor seemed to enjoy playing the scofflaw. As witnesses described her brazen pilfering from public coffers, she remained impassive, an unrepentant defendant bedecked in expensive clothes and oversize hats.\n\nLinda Taylor, the haughty thief who drove her Cadillac to the public aid office, was the embodiment of a pernicious stereotype. With her story, Reagan marked millions of America\u2019s poorest people as potential scoundrels and fostered the belief that welfare fraud was a nationwide epidemic that needed to be stamped out. This image of grand and rampant welfare fraud allowed Reagan to sell voters on his cuts to public assistance spending. The \u201cwelfare queen\u201d became a convenient villain, a woman everyone could hate. She was a lazy black con artist, unashamed of cadging the money that honest folks worked so hard to earn.\n\nPhoto by Constantine Manos/Magnum Photos\n\nAfter her welfare fraud trial in 1977, Taylor went to prison, and the newspapers moved on to covering the next outlandish villain. When her sentence was up, she changed her name and left Chicago, and the cops who had pursued her in Illinois lost track of her whereabouts. None of the police officers I talked to knew whether she was still alive.\n\nWhen I set out in search of Linda Taylor, I hoped to find the real story of the woman who played such an outsize role in American politics\u2014who she was, where she came from, and what her life was like before and after she became the national symbol of unearned prosperity. What I found was a woman who destroyed lives, someone far more depraved than even Ronald Reagan could have imagined. In the 1970s alone, Taylor was investigated for homicide, kidnapping, and baby trafficking. The detective who tried desperately to put her away believes she\u2019s responsible for one of Chicago\u2019s most legendary crimes, one that remains unsolved to this day. Welfare fraud was likely the least of the welfare queen\u2019s offenses.\n\nFor those who knew her decades ago, Linda Taylor was a terrifying figure. On multiple occasions, I had potential sources tell me they didn\u2019t think I was really a journalist. Maybe I was a cop. Maybe I was trying to kill them. As Lamar Jones tells me about his brief marriage to the welfare queen, he keeps asking how I\u2019ve found him, and why I want to know all of these personal details. If I\u2019m in cahoots with Linda, as he suspects I might be, he assures me that I won\u2019t be able to find him again. He\u2019s just going to disappear.\n\nThose who crossed paths with Linda Taylor believe she\u2019s capable of absolutely anything. They also hope she\u2019s dead.\n\n2 \u201cShe Can Be Any Age She Wishes\u201d\n\nJack Sherwin knew he\u2019d seen her before. It was Aug. 8, 1974, and the Chicago burglary detective was working a case on the city\u2019s South Side. Though her name and face didn\u2019t look familiar, Sherwin recognized the victim\u2019s manner, and her story. She\u2019d been robbed, Linda Taylor explained, and she was sorry to report that the burglar had good taste: $14,000 in furs, jewelry, and cash were missing from her apartment. Thank heavens, most of it was insured.\n\nAfter listening to her tale of woe, Sherwin asked Taylor if she\u2019d mind getting him some water. When she returned, the detective kept the glass as evidence.\n\nCourtesy of Jack Sherwin\n\nThe fingerprints collected from Taylor\u2019s kitchen helped jog Sherwin\u2019s memory. Two years earlier, the same woman had been charged with making a bogus robbery claim\u2014that time, the thieves had supposedly made off with $10,000 worth of valuables. Sherwin knew Linda Taylor because, out of pure happenstance, he\u2019d been called on to investigate both of these alleged burglaries. She was living in a different part of town, using a different name, and sporting a different head of hair. But this was the same woman, pulling the same stunt.\n\nSherwin cited Taylor, again, for making a false report. But the 35-year-old police officer, a former Marine and a 12-year veteran of the force, didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cThe more I dug into it, the more I found that just wasn\u2019t right,\u201d he remembers. First, he learned that she was getting welfare checks under multiple names. Then he discovered Taylor\u2019s husbands\u2014\u201cOh, I guess maybe seven men that I knew of,\u201d Sherwin says. The detective and his partner, Jerry Kush, got to work tracking down this parade of grooms, and they found a few who were willing to talk. Sherwin\u2019s hunch had been right: This woman was up to no good.\n\nIn late September 1974, seven weeks after Sherwin met Taylor for the second time, the detective\u2019s findings made the Chicago Tribune. \u201cLinda Taylor received Illinois welfare checks and food stamps, even tho[ugh] she was driving three 1974 autos\u2014a Cadillac, a Lincoln, and a Chevrolet station wagon\u2014claimed to own four South Side buildings, and was about to leave for a vacation in Hawaii,\u201d wrote Pulitzer Prize winner George Bliss. The story detailed a 14-page report that Sherwin had put together illuminating \u201ca lifestyle of false identities that seemed calculated to confuse our computerized, credit-oriented society.\u201d There was evidence that the 47-year-old Taylor had used three Social Security cards, 27 names, 31 addresses, and 25 phone numbers to fuel her mischief, not to mention 30 different wigs.\n\nAs the Tribune and other outlets stayed on the story, those figures continued to rise. Reporters noted that Linda Taylor had used as many as 80 names, and that she\u2019d received at least $150,000\u2014in illicit welfare cash, the numbers that Ronald Reagan would cite on the campaign trail in 1976. (Though she used dozens of different identities, I\u2019ve chosen to call her Linda Taylor in this story, as it\u2019s how the public came to know her at the height of her infamy.) Taylor also gained a reputation as a master of disguise. \"She is black, but is able to pass herself off as Spanish, Filipino, white, and black,\" the executive director of Illinois\u2019 Legislative Advisory Committee on Public Aid told the Associated Press in November 1974. \"And it appears she can be any age she wishes, from the early 20s to the early 50s.\u201d\n\nFor Bliss and the Tribune, the scandal wasn\u2019t just that Taylor had her hand in the till and had the seeming ability to shape-shift. The newspaper also directed its ire at the sclerotic bureaucracy that allowed her schemes to flourish. Bliss had been reporting on waste, fraud, and mismanagement in the Illinois Department of Public Aid for a long time prior to Taylor\u2019s emergence. His stories\u2014on doctors who billed Medicaid for fictitious procedures and overworked caseworkers who failed to purge ineligible recipients from the welfare rolls\u2014showed an agency in disarray. That disarray didn\u2019t make for an engaging read, though: \u201cState orders probe of Medicaid\u201d is not a headline that provokes shock and anger. Then the welfare queen came along and dressed the scandal up in a fur coat. This was a crime that people could comprehend, and Linda Taylor was the perfectly unsympathetic figure for outraged citizens to point a finger at.\n\nPhoto illustration by Holly Allen\n\nNow that the Tribune had found the central character in this ongoing welfare drama, a story about large, dysfunctional institutions became a lot more personal. The failure\u2014or worse, unwillingness\u2014to ferret out Taylor\u2019s dirty deeds revealed more about the flaws of state and county government than any balance sheet ever could. In his report to his superiors at the Chicago Police Department, Sherwin described ping-ponging from the Department of Public Aid to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to the U.S. attorney, with none of the agencies expressing much interest in helping him out. The Tribune\u2019s headline: \u201cCops find deceit\u2014but no one cares.\u201d\n\nSherwin eventually found a willing partner in the Legislative Advisory Committee on Public Aid, a body put together by state legislators eager to take a stand against government waste. The detective also learned that Taylor was wanted on felony welfare fraud charges in Michigan. At the end of August 1974, she was arrested in Chicago, then released on bond in advance of an extradition hearing. A month later\u2014and the day after the Tribune told her story for the first time\u2014Linda Taylor didn\u2019t answer when her name was called in Cook County Circuit Court. The most notorious woman in Illinois was on the lam.\n\n3 \u201cThe Woman Was Smooth\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 12, 1974\u2014four days after Linda Taylor told Jack Sherwin she\u2019d been robbed\u2014Lamar Jones met his future bride. The 21-year-old sailor was working in the dental clinic at Chicago\u2019s Great Lakes Naval Training Center when a beautiful woman walked in to get her teeth cleaned. Something about her was totally fascinating, Jones remembers. \u201cI met her because she was pretty and I was shooting game to her,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess her game must\u2019ve been stronger than mine, because I met her that Monday and [got] married that Saturday.\u201d\n\nJones thought he was lucky to get hitched to the 35-year-old Linda Sholvia. She was beautiful, with the smoothest skin he\u2019d ever seen. She also gave him $1,000 as a wedding present, and he had his pick of fancy new cars. But Lamar and Linda\u2019s marriage lasted only a little longer than their five-day courtship. A few weeks after they exchanged vows, Linda was arrested. When Jones paid her bond, his new wife fled the state. To make things worse, she stole his color TV.\n\nThe young Navy man realized that something was amiss with his new bride even before the television went missing. When she showed him a degree from a university in Haiti, he noticed that it said Linda Taylor, not Linda Sholvia. Jones says Linda had five mailboxes at her residence at 8221 S. Clyde Ave., and she\u2019d get letters in all five, addressed to different names. He got a bit uneasy when Linda told him, after they were married, that he was her eighth husband. She also had a \u201csister\u201d named Constance who seemed more like her adult daughter.\n\nHer skin was so pale and smooth, he says, that she could look Asian, or like a light-skinned black woman, or even white. One night, though, he woke up before dawn and saw that his bride\u2019s smooth skin wasn\u2019t so perfect\u2014she had \u201c1,000 wrinkles on her face.\u201d After he caught this illicit glimpse, Linda locked herself in the bathroom for an hour. When she came out, she looked like a whole new person.\n\nPhoto illustration by Holly Allen\n\nOnce Linda fled the state, that ended all hope of salvaging their three-week marriage. Jones says at that point he cooperated with authorities, who wiretapped his phone and traced one of the fugitive\u2019s calls. On Oct. 9, \u201cConstance Green\u201d was apprehended in Tucson, Ariz., on behalf of Chicago police. Three days later, the Tribune\u2019s George Bliss wrote that \u201cthe 47-year-old \u2018welfare queen\u2019 was being held in a [Tucson] jail.\u201d It\u2019s the first instance I\u2019ve found of someone being branded a \u201cwelfare queen\u201d in print.\n\n\n\nA month after his wife was brought back from Arizona, Lamar Jones testified against her in front of a Cook County grand jury. Jones says that around the time of that proceeding, he was shuffled into a car with another witness and told they had something in common: They were both married to Linda (or maybe it was Connie) at the same time. That was a surprise to Jones. His wife had told him that husband No. 7 was dead.\n\nCircuit Court of Cook County\n\nOn Nov. 13, Taylor was indicted on charges of theft, perjury, and bigamy. (The bigamy charges were later dropped.) In court records listing the counts of the indictment, the defendant\u2019s name is recorded as Connie Walker, aka Linda Bennett, aka Linda Taylor, aka Linda Jones, aka Connie Jarvis. She was either 35, 39, 40, or 47 years old, depending on whose story you believed.\n\nGiven all the superlatives that attached themselves to Taylor\u2014the executive director of the Legislative Advisory Committee on Public Aid told the Tribune, \u201cShe is without a doubt, the biggest welfare cheat of all time\u201d\u2014the charges against her weren\u2019t all that impressive. One of the assistant state\u2019s attorneys prosecuting Taylor told the UPI that all the rumors were \u201cprobably\u201d true. \u201cBut what makes me angry about all the stories is that most of them are not indictable,\" she said. \"We simply don't have the facts on all of those things.\u201d The Tribune reported that Taylor was filching every form of public assistance imaginable: Social Security, food stamps, Medicaid, and Aid to Families With Dependent Children. But the hard evidence\u2014canceled AFDC checks, and Medicaid ID cards under multiple names\u2014allowed the state to charge her with stealing $8,000 from the public coffers, nothing more.\n\nTaylor\u2019s welfare fraud case stalled in the courts for long enough that her 1974 indictment remained campaign fodder for Ronald Reagan in 1976. The yawning chasm between \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cindictable\u201d was wide enough for Reagan to label Linda Taylor a public scourge, and for the candidate\u2019s critics to claim she was a media myth. In October 1976, Reagan\u2014who had lost that year\u2019s GOP nomination to Gerald Ford\u2014devoted one of his regular radio commentaries to updating the story of the \u201cwelfare queen, as she\u2019s now called.\u201d (While I haven\u2019t found any examples of him saying \u201cwelfare queen\u201d on the stump in 1976, he did use the term in this radio address.) According to Reagan, it had now been revealed that this woman (he still didn\u2019t identify her by name) had operated in 14 states using 127 names, claimed to be the mother of 14 children, was using 50 addresses \u201cin Chicago alone,\u201d and had posed as an open heart surgeon. She also had \u201cthree new cars, a full-length mink coat, and her take is estimated at a million dollars.\u201d\n\nWhile Reagan sourced his report to \u201cthe chief investigative reporter of the Chicago Tribune,\u201d I can\u2019t find anything in the Tribune to support the claim that Taylor\u2019s take reached $1 million. The bits about the new cars and the fur coat were accurate, though. And the part about her posing as a heart surgeon\u2014that was probably true, too.\n\nThe Tribune printed so many incredible stories about Linda Taylor that it really wasn\u2019t necessary for Reagan to exaggerate the figures. As he\u2019d said, Taylor had posed in Michigan as a heart surgeon named Dr. Connie Walker and, in the Tribune\u2019s telling, \u201cdrove a new Cadillac bearing the physicians\u2019 staff and serpent on both doors and the word \u2018Afri-med\u2019 on the rear.\u201d According to other accounts, she allegedly practiced voodoo and had traveled to Jamaica after being released from jail. In September 1975, Taylor\u2019s son-in-law and her daughter Sandra were indicted for getting fraudulent Aid to Families With Dependent Children payments. A month later, with Taylor out on bond and awaiting trial for welfare fraud, she told police that two men with guns had barged into her apartment and stolen $17,000 in jewelry\u2014a crime reminiscent of those phony burglaries that led the Chicago police to start digging into her tangled life.\n\nIn February 1976, Jack Sherwin dropped in on Taylor\u2019s home to deal with yet another burglary case. This time, Chicago\u2019s welfare queen was the alleged perpetrator, not the victim. Taylor allegedly had snatched $800 worth of items from a woman she\u2019d been living with. The police found the victim\u2019s electric can opener, color TV, and fur coat squirreled away in Taylor\u2019s apartment building, though a three-piece polka-dot pantsuit was not recovered. The officers also found two small children living in squalid conditions. The boys, a white 7-year-old and a black 5-year-old, were taken into protective custody.\n\nThe subsequent news stories focused on Taylor\u2019s car, which was impounded because she\u2019d allegedly used it in the commission of the crime. The headline in the New York Times: \u201c \u2018Welfare Queen\u2019 Loses Her Cadillac Limousine.\u201d The newspapers did not mention all the other evidence found in Taylor\u2019s home. A partial rundown of the items seized, as listed in the police report:\n\nCircuit Court of Cook County\n\nphone bill carrying the name Mary Stevenson, c/o Willtrue Loyd\n\nChicago Motor Club document bearing the name Yepez Juventino\n\na Chicago Motor Club card for Linda C. Jones\n\nan AMOCO Motor Club card for Linda C. Wakefield\n\nAllstate Insurance Co. letter to Linda Bennett\n\na department store credit card in the name Patricia M. Parks\n\ncoroner\u2019s death certificate for Frank Brown\n\nbusiness letter from Martin Fertal attorney at law to Mrs. Lillian McIntosh\n\nVeterans Administration letter to Mrs. Constance Howard\n\nauto insurance policy in the name of Linda C. Wakefield\n\nVeterans Administration letter to Jessie L. Green\n\nmembership document of \u201cEpsilon Delta Chi\u201d certifying Connie R. Walker, Ph.D., M.D., as member\n\nmembership card for Epsilon Delta Chi in name Dr. Linda C. Wakefield\n\nbirth certificates for children named Willie and Hosey\n\na personal letter signed \u201cHusband Ray\u201d\n\na rent receipt from Mrs. Linda Ray to Everleana Brame\n\na mortgage receipt for J&P Parks\n\na mortgage notice, for the same address, for Linda C. Wakefield\n\na receipt for a safety deposit box in the name Linda C. Jones\n\na telephone bill addressed to Sherman F. Ray\n\nenvelope addressed to Linda Ray\n\ntwo lottery tickets\n\nIn addition to this remarkable collection of documented pseudonyms, Taylor\u2019s cache includes many other people\u2019s names\u2014on a credit card, a telephone bill, and all manner of documents. These are not aliases. They are possible victims.\n\nFor much of the 1970s, Taylor had consistent legal representation from celebrated black Chicago attorney R. Eugene Pincham. In the run-up to Taylor\u2019s welfare fraud trial, Pincham\u2014who managed to delay the proceedings for years, winning continuance after continuance\u2014positioned his client as a victim of coldhearted, overreaching prosecutors. \u201cIt would be a pretty sorry situation if the state tried to prosecute and send to jail everybody from the South Side that took welfare money they didn't have coming,\" he told the Tribune in 1976. \"There'd just be nowhere to put them.\u201d Prosecutors, meanwhile, called Taylor a \u201cparasitic growth,\u201d a leech who gleefully extracted taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nTaylor didn\u2019t help her legal team sell the idea that she was a piteous victim. The AP described her courtroom attire as \u201cbrightly colored mod outfits with sparkling rings and bracelets,\u201d a gaudy wardrobe that gave TV crews and newspaper photographers the perfect welfare queen action shot. Isaiah Gant, who eventually took over Taylor\u2019s case from his colleague Pincham, says she\u2019d position herself to be seen by the cameras but would not deign to speak. \u201cDoing interviews would have made her commonplace,\u201d Gant says.\n\nThe trial of the welfare queen finally began in March 1977, two-and-a-half years after Det. Jack Sherwin cited Taylor for making a false burglary report. Sherwin testified that he\u2019d observed Taylor with green Medicaid ID cards carrying the names Connie Walker and Linda Bennett. An FBI handwriting expert, too, took the stand to say that 13 of the Walker and Bennett signatures on her monthly AFDC checks, which ranged in value from $249 to $464, were \u201cdefinitely\u201d written in Taylor\u2019s hand.\n\nPhoto by Charles Knoblock/AP via Corbis\n\nIt took the jury seven hours to find Taylor guilty. Judge Mark Jones sentenced her to two to six years for theft and one for perjury, with the terms to be served consecutively. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Taylor, always poker-faced in court, had tears in her eyes when she learned her fate.\n\nShedding a tear is a rational response to a felony conviction. Taylor\u2019s behavior before, during, and after the trial, by contrast, was consistently bizarre and brazen. While Taylor was awaiting sentencing, Judge Jones revoked her bond when the home address she\u2019d given a probation officer turned out to be a vacant lot. Though she\u2019d been called Linda Taylor throughout the trial, she now told a different story: \u201cThey're looking for Linda Taylor, and I'm not Linda Taylor.\u201d A few months later, she was released from custody briefly while her case was on appeal. According to Cook County prosecutor James Piper, she subsequently \u201capplied for welfare, claiming she needed the money for medical purposes.\u201d Piper told the St. Louis Globe-Democrat that she was suspected of falsifying information on the application.\n\nWas Taylor a cold and calculating grifter? Was she mentally ill? Isaiah Gant, who has been an attorney for nearly four decades, says his onetime client \u201cwas a scam artist like I have never run across since.\u201d Gant, now an assistant federal public defender in Nashville, Tenn., says Taylor could change personalities in an instant. \u201cIf she wanted to be a ho, she could be a ho. If she wanted to be a princess, she could be a princess,\u201d he says. \u201cThe woman was smooth.\u201d\n\nWhen she was preparing to stand trial for the 1976 theft of an electric can opener and fur coat, another of Taylor\u2019s attorneys had asked the court to have her submit to a behavioral clinic examination. In that petition, her lawyer explained that Taylor\u2019s former attorneys had informed him \u201cthat the Defendant was incapable of knowing whether or not she was telling the truth.\u201d In addition, there were \u201creports of two psychiatrists who examined her which referred to her as being psychotic and unable to understand the nature of the proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe petition for a medical examination was ultimately denied. In February 1978, the welfare queen entered Illinois\u2019 Dwight Correctional Center. According to the Sun-Times, while incarcerated she worked cleaning her fellow inmates\u2019 cottages. As of March 1979, she had a minor violation on her prison record, having \u201callegedly used state-owned materials to make cushions and sell them.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Linda Taylor disappeared from newsprint. By the end of the 1970s, Taylor had become a historical footnote. The welfare queen was forgotten before anyone figured out who she really was.\n\n4 \u201cEnough Strychnine to Kill a Dozen People\u201d\n\nIt took a crew of cops nearly 20 hours to count all the cash. There were coins and bills stuffed in the furniture, sheathed in piles of clothes, and stuffed inside laundry bags, pillowcases, cardboard boxes, and an old foot locker. A deputy superintendent said that it was the biggest haul he\u2019d come across in 23 years on the force. The final tally: $763,223.30.\n\nThe Chicago police had gone to Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s house on Feb. 18, 1964, after getting a report that he was deathly ill. When cops and firemen arrived on the scene, they spotted coin wrappers and betting slips\u2014the calling cards of a gambling operation. Just hours after the authorities raided his living room, Wakefield died in the hospital of an intracranial hemorrhage. His death certificate identifies him as a 60-year-old \u201cNegro.\u201d\n\nPhoto by UPI via Corbis\n\nEverybody on the South Side of Chicago knew Wakefield was a hustler, but they didn\u2019t think he was this good at it. Wakefield operated a policy racket, a kind of underground lottery that thrived in the Windy City until the 1970s. Neighborhood proprietors fished numbers out of a drum, and bettors won by matching the resulting combination\u2014the UPI termed it \u201cthe poor man\u2019s stock market.\u201d\n\nBy the mid-1960s, the Italian mob had muscled most of the black kingpins out of the policy game, but they hadn\u2019t hassled the shabby, modest-living Wakefield. Why bother? The guy was clearly small time.\n\nIt was probably true that Wakefield\u2019s glory days were long gone\u2014some of the greenbacks the cops uncovered were a half-century old. But the money was still real, even if he preferred hoarding it to spending it. Since he hadn\u2019t been charged with any crime, the police didn\u2019t confiscate Wakefield\u2019s bounty. Now, it wasn\u2019t clear how to disburse this windfall. Wakefield hadn\u2019t made out a will, and he had no known living relatives.\n\nWhen photos of all that cash hit the Chicago papers, more than a dozen alleged heirs emerged to grab for the money. One contender was Rose Kennedy, a 66-year-old white woman who said she was Wakefield\u2019s common-law wife. According to Kennedy, she and her late husband\u2014who had died 30 years earlier\u2014had invested $160,000 to start their own policy operation in Chicago. When her husband passed away, Kennedy explained, Lawrence Wakefield had taken the reins of their operation, and she\u2019d become his live-in companion.\n\nKennedy\u2019s toughest competition for the loot was a woman named Constance Wakefield. On April 18, 1964, the city\u2019s black newspaper, The Chicago Defender, splashed a headline across its front page: \u201cDead Policy King\u2019s $763,000 Demanded By His \u2018Daughter\u2019: Has Papers To Prove Her Claim.\u201d The first two paragraphs of the story read skeptically:\n\nA 29-year-old woman who claims to be the daughter of the late policy king, Lawrence Wakefield, has unfolded a fantastic story of \"plots\" and intrigues which separated her from her \"father.\"\n\nThe claimant, Constance Beverly Wakefield, who lives on Chicago's Northside, showed the DEFENDER an array of \"documents\" which, she claims, prove she is the daughter of Wakefield.\n\nGraphic by Slate.\n\nThe Defender\u2019s reporter described an unusual scene at Constance Wakefield\u2019s home, which was protected by a bodyguard, decorated with \u201codd figurines,\u201d and featured a myna bird that \u201cconstantly squawked the name \u2018Lawrence.\u2019 \u201d The 29-year-old Constance, who showed \u201csigns of having been a beauty in her younger days,\u201d produced a 1935 birth certificate listing her parents as Lawrence R. Wakefield and Edith L. Jarvis. Constance said she\u2019d grown up in Blytheville, Ark., and had believed until recently that this Edith Jarvis was her grandmother.\n\nIt got stranger from there. Constance told the Defender that Rose Kennedy, Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s purported common-law wife, was no such thing. She also accused Kennedy of trying to poison her, saying, \u201cThe doctors said I had swallowed enough strychnine to kill a dozen people.\u201d And in just the last few weeks, she reported, police had captured two white men trying to break into her house; a \u201cswarthy Italian\u201d had threatened to kill her; and her bodyguard had narrowly thwarted an attempt to blow up her 1964 Cadillac. A few days after that, the Associated Negro Press wrote that Constance Wakefield Steinberg\u2014she was a \u201clight-skinned Negro woman with a \u2018Jewish\u2019 surname\u201d\u2014\u201creported to police that her 11-year-old son, John, had been kidnapped and that she had received a number of threatening calls.\u201d\n\nWhether she was going by Constance Wakefield, Linda Taylor, or any other name, the future welfare queen never went for subtlety. She was a woman of great ambition, and she conjured a universe in which the forces arrayed against her were equally extraordinary. Someone was always trying to kill her, or steal from her, or kidnap her, or take her children. These stories rarely checked out. Her son John, the Chicago Sun-Times would report, hadn\u2019t been kidnapped. He was found by FBI agents wandering near his house, and explained that he\u2019d run away after a fight with his sister. Census records and Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s own death certificate reveal that Edith Jarvis was not Wakefield\u2019s wife, as Taylor had asserted\u2014she was his mother. When Taylor went to probate court to press her claim to the Wakefield fortune, even more of her story fell apart.\n\nConstance Wakefield was many people, but she probably wasn\u2019t Constance Wakefield.\n\nIn this and many of her other battles, Linda Taylor\u2019s weapons were documents, paperwork of uncertain provenance that buttressed her version of events. Though her birth to Lawrence and Edith did not appear in contemporaneous records, she procured a delayed birth certificate from the doctor who she claimed had delivered her. She also furnished a pair of Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s heretofore-undiscovered wills. The first, which dated to 1943, included a description of Wakefield\u2019s daughter that matched her own, \u201cspecifically describing a scar and a mole and their location on her body,\u201d the Tribune reported. The second will, from 1962, indicated that Wakefield had $2 million, that the vast majority of that lucre should go to his daughter, and that Rose Kennedy\u2014who Taylor maintained was Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s housekeeper, not his common-law wife\u2014was entitled to precisely $1. \"She is no good and will try to take everything from my baby,\u201d the will read, according to the Tribune. \u201cShe has stoled enough from me since the death of my Edith.\"\n\nNone of this evidence\u2014the delayed birth certificate, the will that conveniently trashed her primary rival\u2014convinced Cook County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Gerald Mannix that he was dealing with Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s real daughter. A long way from Chicago, he found someone who could help him prove it.\n\n\u201cA surprise witness testified in Probate court yesterday that Miss Constance Wakefield, who claims to be the illegitimate daughter of the late Lawrence Wakefield, policy king, and thus heir to his fortune, actually is Martha Louise White,\u201d the Tribune reported on Nov. 10, 1964. Hubert Mooney, who claimed to be Martha\u2019s uncle, explained that his niece was born in Summit, Ala., around 1926, making her about 38 years old\u2014nine years older than she\u2019d claimed to be in the guise of Constance Wakefield. Martha, Mooney said, was the daughter of his sister Lydie and a man named Marvin White. The court didn\u2019t have to take his word for it. Hubert\u2019s 84-year-old mother came from Tennessee to testify that she\u2019d assisted in her granddaughter Martha\u2019s birth.\n\nMooney said he\u2019d seen his niece most recently in Arkansas\u2014the state where \u201cConstance Wakefield\u201d had grown up, according to her interview with The Chicago Defender. He\u2019d also run into her in Oakland, Calif. On that occasion, she\u2019d asked her uncle to bail her out of jail. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the assistant state\u2019s attorney produced fingerprints and \u201cpolice records from Oakland, which he said were those of Miss Wakefield, listing arrests for prostitution, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and assault.\u201d A police expert testified that those fingerprints matched those of Beverly Singleton, a woman who\u2019d been arrested the year prior for assaulting a 12-year-old girl. Constance Wakefield, it seemed, was many people, but she probably wasn\u2019t Constance Wakefield.\n\nPhoto illustration by Holly Allen\n\nThis dramatic testimony didn\u2019t clear everything up. For her part, \u201cConstance Wakefield\u201d said she knew Hubert Mooney but that she was not Martha Louise White. She also denied that she was the woman identified in all those criminal records, though she did confess that she\u2019d been charged with assault in Oakland.\n\nWeighing all the evidence, Judge Anthony Kogut cited Taylor for contempt of court and sentenced her to six months in jail. She wouldn\u2019t get any of Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s money, the balance of which would go to Rose Kennedy, the policy king\u2019s common-law wife.\n\nFor Hubert Mooney, who died in 2009, this was a jarring experience. His daughter Joan Shefferd says Mooney was from a different era, and that he was a very prejudiced man. Taylor\u2019s behavior, she says, made her father angrier than she\u2019d ever seen him. His niece\u2019s lying and scheming were one thing, but there was something else he\u2019d never understand. Why was Martha Louise White passing herself off as a black woman?\n\n5 A Mixed-Race Family in the Deep South\n\nForty-five years before she became the welfare queen, Linda Taylor was a little girl on a farm in Mississippi County, Ark. The 1930 census identifies her as Martha Miller, one of three children of Joe Miller, a cotton farmer. Joe\u2019s wife was Lidy Miller (written in other documents as Lyde or Lydie).\n\nThough her Uncle Hubert testified that Taylor was born in Summit, Ala., the census says her place of birth is Tennessee. She\u2019s listed as 4 years old in 1930 and 13 in the 1940 survey, meaning she was born sometime between 1925 and 1927. As of 1940, the 13-year-old girl had attended school, but had gone only so far as the second grade. And in the box labeled \u201ccolor or race,\u201d she\u2019s marked with a \u201cW\u201d for white, just like everyone else in her family.\n\nCourtesy National Archives. Graphic by Slate.\n\nThose who, back then, knew Linda Taylor as Martha remember her as a willful child: If you told her she couldn\u2019t do something, she\u2019d set out to prove you wrong. She also didn\u2019t look like her parents and siblings. Shelby Tuitavuki, who grew up near the Miller family in Arkansas, says Taylor had long black hair and dark skin. \u201cI think she could\u2019ve been black,\u201d the 71-year-old Tuitavuki says. Joan Shefferd, who\u2019s 62 and lives in Kansas, doesn\u2019t believe Taylor was really black. She says her cousin\u2019s pigmentation was a product of her family\u2019s Native American heritage.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Taylor\u2019s biological father\u2014identified by Hubert Mooney as a man named Marvin White\u2014was black. Or perhaps a family secret was buried a few more generations back. No matter her bloodlines, the more persistent truth was that Martha Miller\u2014who would later shed her childhood name for a nearly endless set of aliases\u2014was a racial Rorschach test. She was white according to official records and in the view of certain family members who couldn\u2019t imagine it any other way. She was black (or colored, or a Negro) when it suited her needs, or when someone saw a woman they didn\u2019t think, or didn\u2019t want to think, could possibly be Caucasian.\n\nThe young Taylor moved between two very different worlds in the Jim Crow\u2013era South, a type of flexibility that could get a young woman into trouble. Shelby Tuitavuki says that around 1950, Taylor had an affair with Tuitavuki\u2019s uncle, a white man with blond hair and blue eyes. Tuitavuki says her aunt flew into a rage, throwing rocks at her husband\u2019s car and jeering at his paramour, shouting, \u201cCome out, you black nigger!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Taylor\u2019s skin and choice of men that drew scorn. By the early 1950s, she had four children, and they didn\u2019t all look alike. The first, Clifford, was born in 1941, when she was a teenager. He was white. The second, Paul\u2014who, for reasons that have been lost to history, was nicknamed Tojo after the Japanese prime minister\u2014was born in Oakland, Calif., in 1948. On Paul\u2019s birth certificate, his mother is listed as Connie Martha Louise White, a 21-year-old white housewife. (Even at this early stage, Taylor was trying on new names.) The father was Paul Stull Harbaugh, a 24-year-old white Ohio native serving in the U.S. Navy. Paul Jr.\u2019s race is also recorded as white. His skin, though, was dark\u2014much darker than his mother\u2019s.\n\nHer third son, Johnnie, was born in 1950. A short while later, she had a daughter, Sandra. Johnnie, like his brother Cliff, was unmistakably white. Sandra, like her mother, was more racially ambiguous.\n\nTaylor and her children lived an itinerant existence. \u201cWe would go from Arkansas to Mississippi, then from there we\u2019d go to Ohio, California, Chicago,\u201d her son Johnnie remembers. Everywhere they went, there was trouble\u2014the kind you\u2019d expect when a mixed-race family traveled through the Deep South.\n\nTo Johnnie, it seemed like his mother had succumbed to prejudice and hardship\u2014that she\u2019d given up on their mismatched family.\n\n\u201cIf Paul was with us, people used to say, We\u2019ll give you $10, give us some of his hair,\u201d says Johnnie, who is now 63 years old. When they lived in Louisiana, Paul wasn\u2019t allowed to eat inside a white-owned restaurant. Johnnie remembers taking his food outside and joining his older brother under a tree. The two children were ordered to split up, he says, and told there\u2019d be big problems if they were seen together again. His mother was called \u201ca nigger lover and all kinds of prejudiced stuff,\u201d Johnnie says.\n\nThey spent more time in cars than houses, and Johnnie associates each place with a different make and model: a little green Nash in El Paso, Texas, a white Oldsmobile 88 station wagon in Peoria, Ill. When it was time to leave, they left quickly, with each child\u2019s belongings in a single bag. They lived like fugitives. \u201cAs a kid, I didn\u2019t know from one year, one day, one second to the next where I would be tomorrow,\u201d Johnnie says.\n\nCliff left home in his early teenage years, Johnnie says, and then it was just him, Paul, and Sandra. It was them against the world\u2014and often them against their mother. Johnnie says Taylor was not a loving person. She used to beat him, he says, because \u201cI was the odd one\u201d\u2014a white child who saw himself as a black sheep.\n\nWhen Chicago prosecutors unmasked Constance Wakefield in 1964, they revealed that she\u2019d been charged in Oakland with (among other things) contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Later, in Arizona and Illinois, she\u2019d have children taken from her after police found signs of neglect. Throughout her life, wherever she went, she was always picking up children and losing them, other people\u2019s and her own. When Johnnie was young, he says, his mother would often hand her kids over to friends, family, and tenuous acquaintances, with no indication of when or if she\u2019d return. In the mid-1950s, she left Paul with a black family in Missouri. After a brief reunion, she left him again, this time with a family in Chicago. His siblings wouldn\u2019t see Paul again for many years.\n\nJohnnie loved his brother, and he missed him. \u201cI asked her all the time, Where\u2019s Paul? When is Paul coming back?\u201d His mother would say that he was fine, that he was with his grandparents. But Johnnie knew she wasn\u2019t telling the truth. To him, it seemed as though she\u2019d succumbed to prejudice and hardship\u2014that she\u2019d given up on their mismatched family, ditching the child who happened to have the darkest skin.\n\n6 Money and Bodyguards\n\nLife was good in Chicago. Johnnie, his mother, and his sister had a furnished apartment, and the kids all got new bicycles, something they never had when they were younger. Now that they were under the protective wing of Lawrence Wakefield, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nTaylor\u2019s relationship with the black policy king was not a total fantasy she\u2019d conjured in a bid to get a dead man\u2019s money. Johnnie isn\u2019t sure how his mother knew Wakefield, but he says it was clear when they got to Chicago around 1960 that the two of them had history. Johnnie says that his mother would call Lawrence \u201cdad,\u201d and Lawrence would call her his daughter. They didn\u2019t have a sexual relationship so far as he knows, and Wakefield seemed driven to take care of Taylor and her children. They always had money, Johnnie says, and even bodyguards.\n\nPhoto by Josh Levin\n\nIn the early 1960s, they settled in at 1109 N. Damen Ave., in Chicago\u2019s Ukrainian Village. Wakefield was down the block in a building dotted with frosted-glass windows. As a kid, Johnnie says, he carried a few bags for the old man, dropping them off at a jewelry store a half-mile from his house.\n\nEven if he was running numbers for an illegal gambling racket, Johnnie remembers this as an idyllic time\u2014a period of comfort and stability after years on the run. And then, suddenly, Lawrence Wakefield died. \u201cIt was like the whole Earth flipped on us,\u201d Johnnie says.\n\nFor all that he\u2019d done for them in Chicago, Lawrence hadn\u2019t provided for them upon his passing, unless you believed the dubious wills that \u201cConstance Wakefield\u201d waved around in probate court. With the family\u2019s breadwinner out of the picture, Taylor and her children became vagabonds again, moving from house to house on Chicago\u2019s predominantly African-American South Side. For Johnnie, this was devastating, an unwelcome return to the disjointed life he thought he\u2019d left behind. Johnnie\u2019s path to delinquency was now set. At 14, he says, he became a full-time criminal. For the next decade, he was in and out of juvenile detention and prison.\n\nHer son Cliff had left home as a teenager. Paul had been given away as a child. Now, Johnnie was roaming the streets. And on March 3, 1966, The Chicago Defender reported that \u201cConstance\u2019s\u201d daughter was gone.\n\nSandra Stienberg, 13, of 4325 S. Calumet Ave., has been missing from home for 18 days. Her mother, Mrs. Constance Wakefield, says she believes her daughter has been abducted. If she is seen, please notify Chicago police at WA 2-4747.\n\nThere\u2019s almost no chance that Sandra was really kidnapped. Two years prior, Taylor had falsely reported that Johnnie had been abducted. He says now that his mother likely just wanted the cops to do the hard work of tracking him down after he\u2019d left home of his own volition.\n\nIn 1967, she\u2019d try the same line again, telling Chicago police that another of her children had been taken. When the cops investigated, they found that the child wasn\u2019t missing. They also discovered that the kid didn\u2019t belong to her.\n\n7 Who Stole the Fronczak Baby?\n\nThe first time I spoke with Raymond Pagan, he asked if I\u2019d talked to any of the other kids that Taylor had kidnapped. (I had not.) Raymond, who is 46 and lives in Chicago, was very young when he was abducted\u2014his mother says he was 3 when he was returned to her\u2014but he says he remembers other children, and that they were all jammed into the same bed. \u201cThank God I was a kid and I didn't know what the hell was going on,\u201d he says. Still, he had nightmares about Taylor for years.\n\nRaymond\u2019s mother Rose Termini wasn\u2019t worried about leaving her son with Linda Taylor\u2014after all, she had been a good babysitter for her sister\u2019s daughter Anna. When Termini needed someone to watch Raymond for a couple of days, she decided she\u2019d leave him with Taylor, too. \u201cShe acted friendly, nice, kind, and I seen her with her kids, and I seen my niece there,\u201d the now 62-year-old Termini says. There were four or five children there in all, she remembers. \u201cI go, OK\u2014then I trust her. But then when I went back for my son, he was gone.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Josh Levin\n\nTermini says she reached Taylor on the phone a few times, and she would assure her that she\u2019d return Raymond soon. But she never did. Termini remembers taking the bus to the far South Side to search for her son, but Taylor kept changing her address. She didn\u2019t call the police because she was just 16 years old, and she was afraid of what Taylor would do to her and her family. \u201cI was scared of the lady because she had so much money, and I didn't know how to get to her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe had money, jewelry, cars\u2014I mean, she had almost everything she wanted.\u201d Termini says she had a nervous breakdown, and that she ended up in the hospital for months. \u201cI would keep on saying, I gotta find my son, I gotta find my son.\u201d\n\nTermini claims it took her two years to get Raymond back. Her husband, who was in a gang called the Dragons, passed along a message to Taylor\u2019s daughter Sandra that it was time for the abduction to end. Termini recalls that Sandra\u2014who, like her, was a teenager at the time\u2014would say, \u201cI can't bring Raymond to you because [of] my mother.\u201d But she says Sandra eventually relented, telling her mother that she was taking Raymond to a friend\u2019s place for just one night. \u201cEver since then, [Raymond] stayed with me,\u201d Termini says. And after that, she never saw Sandra or Linda Taylor again.\n\nJohnnie Harbaugh says Raymond and Raymond\u2019s cousin Anna both stayed with Taylor, and \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to let either one of them go.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how Rose Termini got Raymond back, but he says he\u2019s the one who rescued Anna. Johnnie says that when Taylor refused to part with Anna, he broke into Taylor\u2019s house early in the morning, snatched the baby, and took the little girl to her mother, Lorraine Termini, on the \u201cL\u201d train.\n\nLorraine Termini died in 2006, and Johnnie\u2019s sister Sandra Smith has refused all interview requests. There is one third-party account that references the Termini kidnappings. In March 1975, when Taylor was waiting to be tried for welfare fraud, the Chicago Tribune\u2019s George Bliss and William Griffin wrote that in 1967, Taylor had asked the police to find her son, \u201cLena Womack.\u201d The cops discovered that the 19-month-old Lena was really Lorraine Termini\u2019s child, and they reported that Johnnie had returned the baby to its real mother.\n\n\n\nJohnnie says the Tribune got part of the story wrong: Lena was Lorraine\u2019s daughter, Anna, not a baby boy. He explains that Taylor, who at various times went by Constance Womack, simply gave the child a new name. The Tribune article also says that Lena/Anna was returned in 1967; Rose Termini\u2019s account places the kidnappings slightly later. Johnnie, Termini, and the Tribune all agree, though, that Linda Taylor took children. The only question is how many.\n\nDid Linda Taylor pull off one of the most notorious kidnappings of the 1960s?\n\nIn another Tribune story, Bliss and Griffin noted that Linda Taylor had been arrested twice in the 1960s for absconding with children, though she wasn\u2019t convicted in either case because the little ones were returned. The reporters also laid out a possible motive. \u201cChicago\u2019s welfare queen,\u201d they wrote, \u201chas been linked by Chicago police to a scheme to defraud the public aid department during the mid-1960s by buying newborn infants to substantiate welfare claims.\u201d\n\nThis theory is a little hard to believe. Given Taylor\u2019s ability to fabricate paperwork, acquiring flesh-and-blood children seems like an unnecessary risk if all you're looking to do is pad a welfare application. Her son Johnnie believes his mother saw children as commodities, something to be acquired and sold. He remembers a little black girl\u2014he doesn\u2019t know her name\u2014who stayed with them for a few months in the early 1960s, \u201cand then she just disappeared one day.\u201d Shortly before Lawrence Wakefield died, Johnnie says, a white baby named Tiger showed up out of nowhere, and then left the household just as mysteriously. I ask him if he knew where these kids came from or who they belonged to. \u201cYou knew they wasn\u2019t hers,\u201d he says.\n\nBefore Wakefield\u2019s death, Johnnie says, his mother\u2019s behavior was unconscionable. After her benefactor passed away in February 1964, it got even worse. In the early 1960s, Taylor had a few babies who came from who-knows-where. Suddenly there were a whole lot more, kids like Anna and/or Raymond\u2014and maybe a boy who was taken from his mother\u2019s arms at Chicago\u2019s Michael Reese Hospital.\n\nOn April 18, 1964, The Chicago Defender ran its interview with \u201cConstance Wakefield,\u201d the one in which she claimed to be the rightful heir to her father Lawrence\u2019s fortune. Nine days later, a newborn child was kidnapped by a woman dressed in a white nurse\u2019s uniform. Dora Fronczak told police that the mystery woman whisked away her son Paul Joseph, telling the new mother that her baby boy needed to be examined by a doctor. Witnesses said the ersatz nurse carried the infant through a rear exit and disappeared.\n\nPhoto by AP via Corbis\n\nThe Fronczak case transfixed Chicago and the nation. The Tribune, the Sun-Times, and the national wire services printed eyewitness accounts, sketches of the suspect, diagrams of the kidnapper\u2019s probable path, and the family\u2019s pleas for their child\u2019s safe return. Within a day, 500 policemen were working the case, including 50 FBI agents. They were looking for a woman between her mid-30s and mid-40s, around 5-foot-4 and 140 pounds, with close-set brown eyes. Nine months after the kidnapping, the Tribune reported that a staggering 38,000 people had been interviewed in connection with the case, and that 7,500 women had been eliminated as suspects. Still, the baby-snatching nurse remained at large.\n\nDid Linda Taylor pull off one of the most notorious kidnappings of the 1960s? In early 1975, law enforcement officials got a tip from one of Taylor\u2019s ex-husbands that she \u201cappeared one day in the mid-1960s with a newborn baby, altho[ugh] she had not been pregnant.\u201d Her explanation, the Tribune said, was that \u201cshe hadn't realized she was pregnant until she gave birth that morning.\u201d\n\nLater that month, the Tribune revealed that Taylor had reportedly told police in 1967 \u201cthat she had given birth to a boy in Edgewater Hospital on Dec. 13, 1963\u2014four months before the birth and kidnaping of the Fronczak baby. That child, she said, was living with foster parents in Chicago Heights.\u201d Police discovered that the birth certificate for this supposed baby was signed by Dr. Grant Sill\u2014the same doctor who had provided a bogus delayed birth certificate showing she was Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s daughter. Dr. Sill, who is now deceased, had agreed to stop practicing medicine in 1970 to avoid prosecution on charges of \u201cselling dangerous drug prescriptions to youngsters.\u201d\n\nJohnnie says his mother often claimed that she worked in a hospital, and that she\u2019d wear a nurse\u2019s hat. Rose Termini, without any prompting, begins the narrative of her son\u2019s kidnapping by saying that Taylor \u201conce told me she was a nurse and she got around a lot with kids.\u201d According to Termini, Taylor would often dress in a white uniform\u2014she says she saw the getup with her own eyes.\n\nIn 1977, a man named Samuel Harper told police prior to Taylor\u2019s sentencing for welfare fraud that he believed she had kidnapped Paul Joseph Fronczak. He explained that he was living with her at the time, that several other white infants were in her home, and that she left the house in a white uniform on the day of the kidnapping. Johnnie Harbaugh confirms that Harper, who was 69 years old in 1977 and likely died many years ago, lived with his mother for a period in the 1960s. If anyone was in a position to know what Linda was up to, Johnnie believes, it was Sam Harper.\n\nJack Sherwin, who retired from the Chicago Police Department in the mid-1990s, says he saw a composite drawing of the Fronczak kidnapper in an FBI office. \u201cI looked at it for a second and knew it was her,\u201d he says. In police reports from the 1970s, Taylor is listed at 5-foot-1 and 140 pounds with brown eyes\u2014not that far off from the suspect\u2019s description. Sherwin says she also had a station wagon at that time that matched the description of the potential getaway car. He believes she was \u201cguilty as hell.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Linda Taylor was never charged in the kidnapping of Paul Joseph Fronczak. Ron Cooper, a retired FBI agent who worked on the Fronczak case in the 1970s, says that they \u201chad no cooperation from people around her.\u201d Everyone who talked \u201cwould tell you a story and it would just sort of be a flim-flam thing, and it wouldn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d If she had taken Paul Joseph in 1964, he was long gone.\n\nJohnnie says he doesn\u2019t know anything about the Fronczak case specifically. He\u2019s always suspected, though, that his mother sold the baby she called Tiger\u2014that would explain her evasiveness, and how an infant could come and go with no explanation. Tiger\u2019s whereabouts remain a mystery. The same goes for the baby abducted from Michael Reese Hospital in 1964. Fifty years later, Paul Joseph Fronczak has yet to be found.\n\n8 \u201cShe Was Going to Get My Badge\u201d\n\nFor Jack Sherwin, the fight to take down Linda Taylor was a multifront war. Some battles were contested face to face. \u201cAt one point the arrestee Linda Taylor stated that no matter how much money it took she was going to get my badge and me,\u201d the detective wrote in one police report. \u201cShe then blurted out that she had a bullet for me. [There] were other things said such as she would tell my wife about all the \u2018Black Ass\u2019 I had.\u201d Taylor also waged a disinformation campaign, calling Sherwin\u2019s superiors to complain that the detective had it in for her. She even took the fight to the astral plane, jabbing sharp pins into a voodoo doll, one she told Sherwin that she\u2019d made especially for him.\n\nSherwin did the digging that led to Taylor\u2019s arrest for welfare fraud, and his testimony helped send her to prison. But four decades after he first met Linda Taylor, the 74-year-old retired detective can\u2019t help but feel that she beat him. She was his prize catch, but Sherwin ended up getting snared in her net.\n\nCircuit Court of Cook County\n\nFrom early August to the end of September 1974, Sherwin unraveled several lifetimes\u2019 worth of Taylor\u2019s scheming. As the detective neared a breakthrough, he paused the investigation to go on his honeymoon. Upon his return, he saw his case splashed across Page 3 of the Chicago Tribune. The paper reported that Sherwin and his partner had used their \u201cblood-hound instincts\u201d to uncover Taylor\u2019s public-assistance scams. Sherwin\u2019s shock at seeing these plaudits in print quickly turned to anger. Thirty-nine years later, he\u2019s still fuming.\n\nHaving the story leak would\u2019ve been bad enough. What made it much, much worse was that Sherwin\u2019s superiors didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been digging into Taylor\u2019s past. Sherwin says Taylor\u2019s persistent complaints had succeeded\u2014he\u2019d been told to back off due to her allegations of harassment. Rather than heed that order, Sherwin and his partner gathered evidence off the clock. \u201cI would\u2019ve had it all put together in a bundle for the bosses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would\u2019ve been happy.\u201d\n\nInstead, the department\u2019s higher-ups learned about his unsanctioned sleuthing on the same day Tribune readers did. George Bliss\u2019 article depicted Sherwin as a swashbuckling hero fighting desperately to convince anyone to take interest in this incredible case of welfare fraud. That didn\u2019t go over well at headquarters. \u201cThe boss who was in charge of my office at the time\u2014oh, was he irate,\u201d Sherwin remembers. He believes the leak torpedoed his career.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Sherwin suffered professionally after the story hit the papers. In the aftermath of that Tribune article\u2014and the one published two weeks later that gave Taylor her famous nickname\u2014Sherwin and his partner were detailed to the investigative unit of the state Senate\u2019s Legislative Advisory Committee on Public Aid. The detective had been looking into a wide range of Taylor\u2019s crimes, but now a police matter had become a political one. The welfare fraud, it seemed, was all that mattered.\n\nFor the Chicago burglary detective, Linda Taylor was never really the welfare queen. He believed she was a kidnapper and a baby seller. Maybe something worse.\n\n9 \u201cShe Killed My Mother\u201d\n\nPatricia Parks-Lee and her two little brothers went to Montessori school, and their mother took them shopping at the big department stores in downtown Chicago. Mrs. Parks, who was also named Patricia, earned her living as a schoolteacher. Her daughter describes her as polished, a woman with a master\u2019s degree who hung out with college-educated types. Parks-Lee says that Linda Taylor, by contrast, looked weathered, like she\u2019d done a lot of hard living. \u201cShe didn\u2019t associate with people like that,\u201d says Parks-Lee, who\u2019s now 48. She believes her mother must have hired Taylor to keep house and watch the kids, nothing more. She says that Linda Taylor was the worst nanny they ever had.\n\nTaylor took up residence with the Parks family in 1974. At that point, Patricia Parks was a healthy woman with three young children. Less than a year later, she was dead. At the time, Taylor was out on bail, awaiting her welfare fraud trial. The Tribune explained that she was now under investigation yet again after authorities \u201clearned that Mrs. Parks reportedly had willed her home to Miss Taylor and had made her the beneficiary of \u2018several\u2019 insurance policies and the guardian of her three children.\u201d\n\nTaylor was pulling off a slow-motion home invasion, and the only witnesses to the crime were a few small children.\n\nParks-Lee was 10 years old when Taylor moved in, and her brothers were 8 and 6. Taylor\u2019s daughter Sandra\u2019s two children stayed at the house for a time as well. Sandra wasn\u2019t around much, but Parks-Lee says she was friendly and jovial, at least compared to her mother. Taylor \u201cwasn't nurturing,\u201d Parks-Lee says. Her attitude toward children: \u201cI don't wanna hear you, I don't wanna see you.\u201d\n\nBefore Linda Taylor moved in, Parks-Lee had her fill of home-cooked Trinidadian cuisine: fish, rice, and homemade bread. Now, with her mother getting sicker and increasingly confined to her bed, she and her brothers barely had anything to eat\u2014it was the only time in her life, Parks-Lee says, that she went to bed hungry. It got so bad that she found her brothers in the pantry with the door closed, trying to hide that they were eating dog biscuits.\n\nParks-Lee had been raised to never question her mother, and now she felt completely lost. \u201cWe didn't go to church anymore, we didn't associate with the people who were my mother's regular friends,\u201d she says. Taylor was pulling off a slow-motion home invasion, and the only witnesses to the crime were a few small children. There was nobody around to answer the questions swirling in the 10-year-old girl\u2019s head: Who was this woman who\u2019d taken over their lives? And what did she want from them?\n\nAs Patricia Parks\u2019 health declined, Taylor rearranged their home. She put Parks in her daughter\u2019s room, and Parks-Lee moved in with her two brothers. Linda Taylor, the new woman of the house, took over their mother\u2019s old room. \u201cLinda would go in and feed her pills,\u201d Parks-Lee says. The children were mostly banished to the back of the house, and Parks\u2019 bedroom was always dark and closed off. Parks-Lee remembers that it was hard for her mom to talk. She would still smile, though, giving her children as much affection as she could muster.\n\n\u201cI never thought my mom was going to die,\u201d Parks-Lee says. Taylor kept saying that Parks was going to get better, but her health never improved. And then, she was gone.\n\nPatricia Marvel Parks passed away on June 15, 1975. She was 37. The death certificate identified the informant as Linda C. Wakefield, \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nTaylor told the funeral director that Patricia Parks had cervical cancer. When her blood was drawn at the funeral home, however, the sample contained a high level of barbiturates. On Parks\u2019 death certificate, the coroner indicated that she had died of \u201ccombined phenobarbital, methapyrilene, and salicylate intoxication.\u201d There is no indication that she had cancer.\n\n\u201cShe killed my mother,\u201d Parks-Lee says. She\u2019s so sure about what Linda Taylor did that she says it three more times: \u201cShe killed my mother. She killed my mother. I just, I mean\u2014she killed my mother.\u201d\n\nFor Patricia and her two brothers, their mother\u2019s death was devastating. For the Chicago newspapers, this potential homicide was an opportunity to gawk at the welfare queen\u2019s strange lifestyle.\n\nPhoto illustration by Holly Allen\n\nThe Tribune reported that \u201cwhen investigators entered the dead woman's bedroom they found five lamps directed toward a hospital bed, a pair of witch doctors' masks hung on walls, candles, a voodoo manual, and a religious statue on a nearby table.\u201d The paper quoted a woman named Frances Fearn who said she had introduced Parks and Taylor. Mrs. Fearn \u201csaid Miss Taylor had identified herself as Linda Mallexo, an African doctor who practiced voodoo.\u201d She also noted that at \u201ctheir first meeting, Miss Taylor told Mrs. Parks that she would die in six months.\u201d\n\nLinda Taylor used to tell people that she got her spiritual training in her supposed home country of Haiti. Johnnie says he remembers his mother practicing voodoo\u2014or, her version of voodoo\u2014as far back as the 1950s. \u201cWe lived in New Orleans and Albany, Louisiana, and all she did was that witchcraft stuff,\u201d he says. Rose Termini, who says Taylor absconded with her son Raymond in the 1960s, says, \u201cOh yeah, she used to play with candles.\u201d Parks-Lee remembers there being \u201cpotions\u201d all over the house. The Tribune also found a woman named Jo Ann McFall who had paid Taylor $1,500 for a series of \u201cspiritualism visits\u201d in 1971. The article continued, \u201cMiss McFall said she ended the sessions when one of Miss Taylor\u2019s sons told her his mother was a \u2018fake and a con woman.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTaylor used her charms to seduce Lamar Jones and her many other husbands. But her powers of persuasion worked on more than just marriageable men. Patricia Parks-Lee says her mother was trusting and naive. As a native of Trinidad, where there\u2019s a long tradition of belief in sorcery and folk magic, she may have been more inclined than most to buy what Linda Taylor was selling. It seems likely that Taylor convinced Parks that she had spiritual skills\u2014and convinced her, somehow, to hand over her children, her property, and access to her bank accounts. When Taylor was arrested for stealing a can opener and fur coat the year after Parks\u2019 death, the dead woman\u2019s credit card was among the items found in her possession.\n\nA murder in Chicago is mundane. A sumptuously attired woman stealing from John Q. Taxpayer is a menace.\n\nAs in the Fronczak kidnapping, Taylor was never charged with killing Patricia Parks. James Piper, the prosecutor in the welfare fraud case, also looked into the alleged Parks homicide. He tells me that he \u201cwas satisfied personally that there had been chicanery.\u201d But Piper says that he wasn\u2019t able to acquire blood samples from the hospital where Parks had been pronounced dead. He believed that without the samples there was no \u201cconnector\u201d\u2014nothing to convince a jury that Taylor had administered a lethal drug cocktail to Parks. Piper says that his decision wouldn\u2019t have prevented the Chicago police from continuing their investigation. He believed, though, that indicting Taylor for murder would have created the perception that he was looking for more publicity for the welfare fraud case\u2014a case with clearer evidence, and one that he didn\u2019t want to jeopardize.\n\nFor Jack Sherwin, this seemed backward. Despite his deep familiarity with Taylor\u2019s criminal methods, Sherwin was never included in the Patricia Parks investigation\u2014he says that would have required Chicago homicide cops to share their turf with a burglary detective, a nonstarter in the territorial department.\n\nOther than Sherwin, nobody seemed all that motivated to learn the full extent of Linda Taylor\u2019s crimes. Though the Tribune wrote about Taylor\u2019s purported connections to the Fronczak kidnapping and the Parks homicide, the paper treated her kid-snatching and voodoo spells as colorful details\u2014odd facts to embellish the shocking welfare queen story. In 1975, the Tribune reported the allegation that Linda Taylor was \u201cbuying newborn infants to substantiate welfare claims.\u201d Somehow, though, the welfare claims remained the bigger story, not the allegations of black-market baby trafficking.\n\nFor Ronald Reagan, Taylor was a tool to convince voters that the government was in crisis. For Reagan\u2019s detractors, she personified the candidate\u2019s penchant for willful exaggeration. For Illinois politicians and prosecutors, the war against Linda Taylor and her ilk was a chance to vent some populist outrage and maybe launch a career. A murder in Chicago is mundane. A sumptuously attired woman stealing from John Q. Taxpayer is a menace, the kind of criminal who victimizes absolutely everyone.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was possible for the Tribune, the Sun-Times, and the Defender to make Linda Taylor a national figure while her specific exploits remained local knowledge. This is how, in the days before the Web abetted the flow of information, Ronald Reagan could tell stories about a real woman and be accused of conjuring a fictional character. And it\u2019s how, after Taylor\u2019s brief window of infamy closed, all the disturbing allegations that had been raised in the mid-1970s just faded away.\n\nPatricia Parks-Lee says she thought that Taylor had been sentenced to 20 years behind bars, and that she\u2019d taken comfort from that fact. In reality, the welfare queen was out of prison much sooner than that, and she had no trouble starting a new life, with a bushel of new names.\n\nTaylor did not get Patricia Parks\u2019 house or custody of her children. After their mother\u2019s death, Parks-Lee and her brothers lived with their father and paternal grandparents. It took more than a year for things to get back to normal, Parks-Lee says, at least as normal as they could possibly be. She remembers finding picked-over food, bones, and seeds that one of her brothers had secreted away underneath his bed\u2014a precaution against future deprivation. Her grandfather would assure the boys that they didn\u2019t have to worry anymore, that \u201cthey could eat till they puked.\u201d\n\nAs she says those words, Patricia Parks-Lee starts to cry. It\u2019s still hard to talk about those days, and to think about the time when Linda Taylor came into her life and destroyed it before she could figure out what was happening. When I first reached out to her, Parks-Lee explains, she was suspicious. \u201cI really thought you were working on her behalf,\u201d she says. Now she has a mission for me: She wants me to track down Linda Taylor, and she wants me to report back that the welfare queen is dead.\n\n10 \u201cShe Was Like a Ghost\u201d\n\nTaylor began serving time for welfare fraud on Feb. 16, 1978. Though Illinois corrections officials say her prison records have been lost, she was a free woman by 1983 at the latest. By the time Taylor won her release, she was closing in on 60 years old, and she was no longer the object of public fascination. When she became a widow in 1983, it didn\u2019t make any headlines. Now, her name was Linda Ray.\n\nGraphic by Slate\n\nOn Aug. 25, 1983, 63-year-old Willtrue Loyd shot and killed 35-year-old Sherman Ray in Momence, Ill., a small town 50 miles south of Chicago. When police arrived at the scene, Loyd confessed to pulling the trigger, explaining that he\u2019d done the deed with the 12-gauge shotgun that was now propped against his trailer. Loyd told the cops that he\u2019d been trying to kill a 7-foot snake that was meandering through his corn patch. All of a sudden, he said, Ray came up behind him and started grabbing at his gun. As they struggled, the firearm discharged inches from Ray\u2019s chest. He was killed instantly.\n\nTaylor had married Sherman Ray, a former Marine, before she landed in prison. Ray\u2019s sister Patricia Dennis says her brother was caring, sincere, and hardworking. When he came back from Vietnam, though, Ray had \u201cemotional problems.\u201d His sister says he had flashbacks, and he\u2019d become agitated if anyone touched him. Dennis, who\u2019s 67 years old and lives in Arizona, says nobody in her family knew Linda Taylor\u2014that she \u201ccame out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nAlong with Sherman Ray, Taylor had another man by her side in Momence: Willtrue Loyd. Johnnie Harbaugh\u2019s wife Carol, Taylor\u2019s daughter-in-law, says Loyd was one of the nicest people she\u2019s ever been around, the kind of guy who\u2019d do anything for you. He was an older gentleman, a World War II veteran, and he was particularly devoted to Taylor\u2014it was as though she had some kind of hold over him.\n\nJohnnie and Carol say that Loyd and Ray were always scuffling, and that this mutual contempt was by design. They believe that Taylor pitted the two men against each other, then stepped back and watched the inevitable result. \u201cLinda would never be present for anything that was happening or going on. Nothing could ever come back to her,\u201d Carol says. \u201cShe was like a ghost.\u201d\n\nAfter making his confession, Loyd was handcuffed and put in a squad car. The next day, he was released due to lack of evidence. At an inquest into the circumstances of Ray\u2019s death, a detective stated that four potential witnesses all told him they hadn\u2019t seen what happened. One man said he\u2019d been drinking with Ray that day, and a bottle of wine was found on the scene. According to a toxicology report, the victim\u2019s blood ethanol count was an extraordinarily high 0.333.\n\nIn the aftermath of Ray\u2019s death, the National Home Life Insurance Company requested a complete coroner\u2019s report from Illinois\u2019 Kankakee County. Byron Keith Lassiter, who looked into the case on behalf of the insurance firm, says such a contestable death claim investigation would have been routine. With no charges filed against Loyd, the money from Sherman Ray\u2019s life insurance policy would be paid out to his wife, Linda.\n\nHolmes County, Fla., Clerk of Court. Graphic by Slate.\n\nA month after Sherman Ray\u2019s death, Taylor bought a parcel of land in Holmes County, Fla. Her name is listed on the deed as \u201cRev. Linda Ray.\u201d In the Sunshine State, public records reveal, she\u2019d use at least six names and six different Social Security numbers. She wasn\u2019t there alone. Her companion was her husband\u2019s killer, Willtrue Loyd.\n\nThis is Linda Taylor\u2019s life in microcosm: a series of tangled connections, a death that serves as a potential windfall, a quick move, and a new start in a faraway place. Sherman Ray, the former Marine with emotional problems, was a man in uniform\u2014a classic Taylor mark. Paul Stull Harbaugh, the man listed as her son Paul\u2019s father on the child\u2019s birth certificate, was in the Navy. So was another supposed husband, Paul Steinberg\u2014the Tribune alleged that in the 1960s she was \u201cobtaining federal support\u201d as the widow of both Harbaugh and Steinberg.\n\nLamar Jones, too, was in the Navy. He claims that when she filled out paperwork to become his dependent in 1974, Linda indicated that another of her husbands had been killed in Vietnam. Given her taste for military men, Jones\u2019 first meeting with \u201cLinda Sholvia\u201d at Great Lakes Naval Training Center takes on a different cast. He thought he was lucky to find such a glamorous woman. It\u2019s more likely that she found him\u2014that Taylor saw something in the 21-year-old Jones that she thought she could exploit.\n\nIn 1978, one of her lawyers wrote that Linda Taylor was likely psychotic, that she \u201cwas incapable of knowing whether or not she was telling the truth.\u201d Johnnie Harbaugh is certain that\u2019s not the case. \u201cShe was cold,\u201d he says. \u201cShe knew what was right and wrong, but she was choosing wrong.\u201d\n\n11 \u201cI\u2019ll Blow Your Head Off\u201d\n\nFor Linda Taylor, people were consumable goods, objects to cultivate, manipulate, and discard. Once she\u2019d extracted something of value\u2014an identity, a check, a life insurance claim\u2014she\u2019d move on to someone else. No matter her circumstances, and no matter her surroundings, there was always a new target.\n\nWhat kind of person behaves this way? In the 1970s, psychologist Robert Hare developed a checklist to assess a given subject\u2019s personality. The symptoms on Hare\u2019s list read like a catalog of Linda Taylor\u2019s known behaviors and personal characteristics: glib and superficial charm, pathological lying, manipulativeness, lack of empathy, parasitic lifestyle, frequent short-term relationships, and criminal versatility.\n\nOf the 20 items on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist\u2013Revised, nearly every one describes the welfare queen to some degree. Dr. Steve Band, a behavioral science consultant and an expert on criminal behavior, says \u201cpeople with that personality know right from wrong.\u201d Dr. James Fallon, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California at Irvine and the author of The Psychopath Inside, says that Taylor \u201cscreams psychopathy.\u201d Along with deriving pleasure from criminal behavior, he says, psychopaths \u201creally like getting away with it\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe ones who have intelligence, they don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d\n\nDespite the striking synchronicity between this checklist and Taylor\u2019s behavior, diagnosing someone as a psychopath isn\u2019t as easy as ticking a set of boxes. As Dave Cullen wrote for Slate in 2004, it took an elite group of mental health experts to establish Columbine shooter Eric Harris\u2019 psychopathic \u201cpattern of grandiosity, glibness, contempt, lack of empathy, and superiority.\u201d\n\nIf a similar team of psychologists scrutinized the welfare queen, Hare\u2019s checklist would be a logical place to start. For her part, Taylor\u2019s daughter-in-law Carol Harbaugh has a simpler list, one with just three points: \u201cShe was brutal. She was mean. She was terrible.\u201d\n\nSome of Taylor\u2019s victims were spared her worst behavior\u2014they just learned an expensive lesson and got on with their lives. Kenneth Lynch, who\u2019s now in his early 80s, bought a property with Taylor in Holmes County, Fla. Lynch remembers her saying that her husband had been killed by mobsters in Chicago. He also says that Taylor never came up with her share of the money, though she did pilfer Lynch\u2019s last name. Reta Hunter, who lives in Live Oak, Fla., says \u201cLinda Lynch\u201d led her to stop trusting people. Taylor told Hunter she was a psychic who\u2019d descended from Caribbean royalty, and that she could help remedy her relationship with her daughter. \u201cThe last time I seen her it cost me $80 for about 20 minutes,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cShe could take you, honey. She was a slick talker.\u201d\n\nNot all of Linda Taylor\u2019s relationships ended so harmlessly. Sherman Ray took a shotgun blast to the chest. Patricia Parks\u2019 life ended in her daughter\u2019s bedroom with her body pumped full of phenobarbital. And an elderly African-American woman named Mildred Markham died in Graceville, Fla., far away from her home and loved ones.\n\nTaylor and Markham met in Chicago in the early 1980s. Markham\u2019s husband James, a retired Pullman porter, earned a good salary in his day. Soon after he passed away, Taylor convinced the railroad man\u2019s widow that she was her long-lost daughter. \u201cAll [Mildred] used to do was talk about this Linda,\u201d recalls Markham\u2019s granddaughter, Theresa Davis, who is 75 and still lives in Chicago.\n\nBy the time she fell under the sway of her new \u201cdaughter,\u201d Mildred Markham was well into her 70s. Davis and her mother tried to convince Markham that Taylor was a con artist, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. Markham went with Taylor to Momence, Ill. From there, they moved to Florida. All the while, according to Davis, \u201cmy grandfather\u2019s money was going out the bank.\u201d She says that as much as $50,000 went missing, along with Markham\u2019s furniture, sewing machine, jewelry, and mink coats. And in 1985, Mildred deeded away 185 acres of Markham family land in Mississippi. The grantees were Linda Lynch and her son Clifford. For his part, Clifford says he had no idea that his name was on the deed, and that he played no part in this land deal.\n\n\n\nLincoln County, Miss., Chancery Clerk\n\nDavis says she and her mother eventually saw evidence of their worst fears: Markham wrote them from Florida saying, without getting into specifics, that she was being mistreated. They tried to find Mildred, but all the addresses on her letters turned out to be phony.\n\nJohnnie and Carol Harbaugh say they saw that abuse firsthand. Johnnie worked as a trucker back then, and he and his wife would see Taylor two or three times a year. She was living on a farm in Graceville, Fla., along with Willtrue Loyd and Mildred Markham.\n\nOnce, when the Harbaughs were in Florida for a visit, Markham begged them to take her back to Chicago. Carol says Taylor was verbally abusive, and that she watched her lock Markham in a room. Markham also told them that she wasn\u2019t being fed. \u201cShe was forced to be there against her will,\u201d Carol says.\n\nThey did not rescue Mildred Markham. Johnnie says that he was determined to take her but that she changed her mind at the last minute and decided to stay. In Carol's recollection, Taylor told Johnnie, \u201cYou even think about it, and I\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201d She says her husband took the threat seriously, and he decided not to get involved.\n\nMildred Markham died on Oct. 5, 1986. Her death certificate says she passed away of \u201cpresumed natural causes,\u201d and that she had previously suffered a stroke. The Graceville police department reported that her husband, Willtrue Loyd, found her body in bed.\n\nCarol Harbaugh says she thought Loyd and Markham had gotten married. Florida records suggest that was probably the case. In March 1986, Loyd married a woman named \u201cConstance Rayner\u201d in Marianna, Fla. The marriage application says Constance\u2019s home state is Louisiana; Theresa Davis says that\u2019s where her grandmother, Mildred Markham, was born. The bride signed her supposed maiden name, Constance Wakefield, in a looping script. It\u2019s a shaky signature, one that doesn\u2019t much resemble Linda Taylor\u2019s tidy penmanship.\n\nFlorida Medical Examiner, District 14. Graphic by Slate.\n\nTaylor always took something from her prey. But this marriage record, with the telltale Wakefield surname, shows that even as she sucked this older woman dry, Taylor was grafting parts of herself onto Mildred Markham.\n\nMarkham\u2019s medical examiner\u2019s file lists her name as Mildred Constance Raner Loyd. Her death certificate (which misspells her first name) indicates that she\u2019s a citizen of Trinidad, and her parents\u2019 names are Frank Raner and Edith Wakefield. According to her granddaughter, Mildred Markham\u2019s maiden name was actually Hampton, and she was born in the United States. Markham\u2019s mother was not Edith Wakefield\u2014back in the 1960s, Linda had tried to convince a judge that Edith Jarvis Wakefield was her own mother. When Markham was still alive, Taylor made her believe that they were mother and daughter. In death, she slotted Markham into her long-running, fictional life story.\n\nAs in the cases of Patricia Parks and Sherman Ray, Taylor stood to gain financially from Mildred Markham\u2019s death. Mildred\u2019s medical examiner\u2019s file includes letters from Union Fidelity Life Insurance and Gulf Life Insurance, both of which were looking to verify the claims of one \u201cLinda Lynch,\u201d the decedent\u2019s daughter. The file also contains a note in which someone, presumably the medical examiner\u2019s assistant, writes that Markham\u2019s daughter \u201ctook out insurance policies at varied times using different names (marriages).\u201d The daughter needed a letter to clear up this misunderstanding, and the medical examiner complied. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge Mildred Constance Raner Loyd, Constance Loyd, and Mildred Rayner are one in the same person,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFlorida Medical Examiner, District 14. Graphic by Slate.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only confusion about Mildred Markham\u2019s death. On May 15, 1987, Dr. D. Bruce Woodham sent a letter to the medical examiner\u2019s office saying that his patient did not die of natural causes. Woodham, a neurological surgeon, wrote that Markham hadn\u2019t suffered a stroke. Rather, she\u2019d fallen and hit her head. \u201cI believe that Ms. Loyd's death was the result of an injury, she fell, she sustained a subdural hematoma, and she herniated from this, and that caused her demise,\u201d the doctor explained.\n\nOn account of Dr. Woodham\u2019s letter, Markham\u2019s death was reclassified as an accident. Regardless, Taylor probably collected on those life insurance policies\u2014so long as there were no accusations of foul play, the companies more than likely paid up.\n\nDr. Woodham, who is still practicing, says that although he wrote that Mildred Markham fell and hit her head, there\u2019s no way he can know with certainty. He\u2019s not a forensic pathologist, and he doesn\u2019t have the expertise to distinguish between injuries that are consistent with a fall or ones that might come from a car accident or a blunt instrument. Dr. Woodham says he doesn\u2019t remember the particulars of this case, but in general he goes by what he\u2019s told\u2014information provided by a paramedic, or possibly a family member.\n\nTheresa Davis does not believe her grandmother fell and hit her head. She is convinced that Mildred Markham was murdered, and that Linda Taylor is somehow responsible.\n\n\n\nSix years after Mildred Markham\u2019s death, her widower Willtrue Loyd died in Florida at age 72. The medical examiner\u2019s report says he succumbed naturally, to heart disease. Loyd\u2019s next of kin is listed as Linda Lynch, his granddaughter. Taylor was only about seven years younger than her \u201cgrandfather.\u201d Nevertheless, as Loyd\u2019s supposed heir, she presumably stood to receive the World War II veteran\u2019s benefits. Another death, another check.\n\nA short time after Loyd passed away, Johnnie Harbaugh and his wife were on vacation in Florida. He says it was around 1994, and Johnnie\u2019s sister Sandra called to say their mother was in bad shape. \u201cShe was a mess when we found her,\u201d Carol Harbaugh says. Taylor was living in Tampa. She\u2019d had several face lifts, and she was wearing raggedy clothes and shoes that were too big for her. She was also \u201cmaking crazy things up,\u201d clearly in the throes of dementia.\n\nJohnnie wanted to leave Linda in Florida, but he brought her back to Chicago out of a sense of obligation. \u201cShe is my mother,\u201d he says. She lived with Johnnie for a short while, then moved in with Sandra. For the next decade, their mother continued her mental and physical decline. In 2002, she was hospitalized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what made me go to the hospital the day that she passed away, but I went there [for] maybe 20 minutes,\u201d Johnnie says. The last thing she told her son was that she had a spider in her chest. She was pounding herself with her fist, Johnnie recalls, trying to kill this imaginary arachnid. It was a horrible, pathetic sight. Johnnie couldn\u2019t stand to see it, so he left. His mother died later that day, April 18, 2002, of a heart attack. She was somewhere between 74 and 77 years old.\n\nCook County Clerk\n\nFor Linda Taylor, documents were never simple accountings of the truth. Pieces of paper always told a story\u2014about her identity, her husbands, her children, her parentage, what was owed to her, and who owed it\u2014and that story was usually self-serving, contradictory, and false. That didn\u2019t change just because she was dead.\n\nHer death certificate, compiled from information provided by her daughter Sandra Smith, is a blend of truth, lies, and conjecture. The welfare queen\u2019s name is rendered as Constance Loyd, which it wasn\u2019t. Her date of birth is listed as Dec. 25, 1934. It wasn\u2019t. She\u2019s described as a homemaker, which she wasn\u2019t. Her father and mother are given as Lawrence Wakefield and Edith Elizabeth Jarvis. They weren\u2019t. Her race is white\u2014the same as in the 1930 and 1940 census. Among her itemized medical conditions is bipolar disorder. That may be true, or it may be a fabrication.\n\nThe welfare queen was cremated. She has no gravestone. For a few years in the 1970s, Linda Taylor\u2019s name was synonymous with greed and sloth. Now she was dead, and nobody noticed.\n\n12 \u201cShe Beat the System\u201d\n\nLinda Taylor\u2019s welfare fraud trial set off a tidal wave of prosecutions. After securing the welfare queen\u2019s conviction, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney James Piper was placed in charge of a special welfare fraud unit. In its first year, Piper\u2019s crew indicted 241 people. \u201cI think the welfare queen Linda Taylor brought about a change in thinking,\u201d Piper told the Tribune. \u201cMillions each year are being stolen and we decided to do something about it.\u201d\n\nWith news of indictments streaming across the front pages of the Tribune and Sun-Times, Illinoisans increasingly saw welfare fraud as a public danger. In a 2007 paper in the Journal of Social History, Julilly Kohler-Hausmann reports that a 1978 poll of Illinois voters found \u201cthat 84 percent ranked controlling welfare and Medicaid fraud and abuses their highest legislative priority.\u201d The Tribune encouraged its readers to hunt down welfare cheats, regularly promoting a fraud hotline set up by the Department of Public Aid. In 1977 alone, that hotline received 10,047 calls. In 1979, close to 2,000 cases of potential welfare fraud were referred to law enforcement in Illinois, an increase of 1,015 percent since 1971.\n\nIllinois embodied a nationwide trend. According to Kohler-Hausmann, welfare fraud investigations increased 729 percent across the country between 1970 and 1979. This wasn\u2019t because fraud was on the rise, she argues\u2014it was because Illinois and other states criminalized welfare overpayments that had once been handled administratively. The rising level of prosecutions didn\u2019t correspond to an increase in benefit levels either. In fact, monthly welfare benefits (that is, payments via Aid to Families With Dependent Children and, after President Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 welfare reform legislation, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) began a long, steady decline in real dollars around the time of Taylor\u2019s trial, one that\u2019s continued to the present day.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to define the exact scope of welfare fraud in America then or now. A 1983 publication sponsored by the Department of Justice, for example, estimated annual Aid to Families With Dependent Children overpayments at between $376 million and $3.2 billion\u2014not exactly a precise range. What\u2019s clear, though, is that Linda Taylor\u2019s larger-than-life example created an indelible, inaccurate impression of public aid recipients.\n\nThe plural of anecdote is not data. The plural of the craziest anecdote you\u2019ve ever heard is definitely not data. And yet, the story of the welfare queen instantly infected the policy debate over welfare reform. Sociologist Richard M. Coughlin notes that in 1979, AFDC families had a median of just 2.1 children and a very low standard of living compared to the average American. In 2013, Bureau of Labor Statistics data continue to bear out the stark economic gap between families on public assistance and those who are not. Linda Taylor showed that it was possible for a dedicated criminal to steal a healthy chunk of welfare money. Her case did not prove that, as a group, public aid recipients were fur-laden thieves bleeding the American economy dry.\n\nIf Linda Taylor had been seen as a suspect rather than a scapegoat, lives may have been saved.\n\nEven so, Ronald Reagan regularly dusted off the welfare queen\u2019s lurid misadventures, arguing that rampant fraud demanded decisive government action. In pushing for welfare reform as president in 1981, he told members of Congress that \u201cin addition to collecting welfare under 123 different names, she also had 55 Social Security cards,\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s much more of [this type of fraud] than anyone realizes.\u201d The recent debate over cuts to the federal food stamp program, too, has featured Republican claims that we can save $30 billion by \u201celiminating loopholes, waste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Reagan wrung savings out of the federal welfare program by slashing benefit levels and raising eligibility requirements. And with regard to today\u2019s food stamp cuts, as Eric Schnurer explains in the Atlantic, \u201cnone of the savings actually come from fraud, but rather from cutting funding and tightening benefits.\u201d\n\nIf Linda Taylor had been seen as a suspect rather than a scapegoat, lives may have been saved. Prosecutors have great discretion in choosing what cases to bring\u2014that\u2019s how the rate of welfare indictments could shoot up so dramatically in a single decade. When politicians and journalists whip the public into a frenzy about welfare fraud, the limitations of municipal budgets and judicial resources dictate that less attention be paid to everything else. Linda Taylor\u2019s story shows that there are real costs associated with this kind of panic, a moral climate in which stealing welfare money takes precedence over kidnapping and homicide.\n\nTaylor was a hard woman to pin down. She was canny, incorrigible, and mobile in a relatively primitive technological era, one in which a determined lawbreaker could make it very difficult to follow her tracks. To gather enough evidence to convincingly tie Taylor to her most serious crimes, the Chicago Police Department would\u2019ve needed to commit to the effort fully. Clearly, they did not. In preventing Jack Sherwin from devoting his abundant energy to stopping the Windy City\u2019s most resourceful criminal, the Chicago police prioritized day-to-day bureaucratic expedience. Sherwin says he wanted to trace Taylor\u2019s husbands and find out what happened to every one of them, but he couldn\u2019t get the go-ahead. He says he \u201cwasn\u2019t given the leeway to do what I really wanted to do.\u201d\n\nWhen cops and prosecutors let Taylor slip through their grasp, they weren\u2019t just setting a dangerous woman loose. They also tossed away their institutional memory of her past schemes. Given the confusion she intentionally sowed, her only match was someone like Sherwin, who\u2019d spent countless hours puzzling out her methods and movements. If Sherman Ray or Mildred Markham had turned up dead in Chicago, then law enforcement hopefully would have been wise enough at that point to launch a full-blown investigation. But Taylor was too smart for that. Once she got her freedom, she relocated to Momence and Graceville, places where nobody knew her many names.\n\nJack Sherwin lost track of Linda Taylor a long time ago. When I tell him that his greatest antagonist died in Chicago in 2002, he says he doesn\u2019t condone anything she did, but that \u201cin her own way, she was a great person. She beat the system.\u201d\n\nPatricia Parks-Lee says she gets a small amount of comfort from knowing that Taylor is dead, but it doesn\u2019t bring her any closure. \u201cMy mom is gone,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll never get answers to my questions. I\u2019ll never know why she did what she did.\u201d\n\nChester and Dora Fronczak never found their son Paul Joseph. Two years after he was kidnapped from a Chicago hospital, the Fronczaks adopted a child who\u2019d been found abandoned in New Jersey. They were certain this was their missing son, christening him Paul Joseph and raising him as if he were the baby that had been taken from them.\n\nJust more than a year ago, the Fronczaks\u2019 adopted son posted a short note on a message board called \u201cOrphan Memories\u201d:\n\nHi, I was identified by the FBI as Paul Joseph fronczak, the kidnapped baby from Michael Reese hospital in Chicago, IL. ... I was abandoned in newark nj on July 2, 1965, found in a stroller outside a variety store. I was placed in an orphanage. When the FBI found me, I was placed in a foster home and given the name \"Scott McKinley.\" I have just found out that I am not Paul Joseph fronczak. I need help to find out who I am.\n\nThis ersatz Paul Joseph is now on a quest to find his true identity. He\u2019s also trying to find the baby that was taken from his adoptive parents. The FBI says it\u2019s pursuing new leads, and ABC\u2019s Barbara Walters recently hosted a 20/20 special on the Fronczak mystery. The man raised as Paul Joseph Fronczak, who is 49 years old (he thinks) and lives in Nevada, tells me that he was not aware of Linda Taylor\u2019s potential connection to the 1964 kidnapping. Special Agent Joan Hyde, the media coordinator for the FBI\u2019s Chicago field office, says the bureau will not comment on an active investigation.\n\nJohnnie Harbaugh says he left his criminal ways behind in the 1970s, and insists that he\u2019s no longer the man his mother raised. But his life hasn't been easy. He\u2019s most often unemployed, and he and his wife struggle to pay their bills with his granddaughter, his son, and his son\u2019s girlfriend living under his roof. He\u2019s got several cars in his garage in Chicago\u2019s northwest suburbs: a truck, a PT Cruiser. He waits until he\u2019s almost broke and then he sells one.\n\nPhoto by Josh Levin\n\nJohnnie believes that his mother was capable of almost anything\u2014that for her, family was a means to an end. His wife Carol says that after Taylor got out of prison, they learned to put padlocks on their interior doors to protect their property and themselves. Johnnie tells me his mother tried to poison him with castor oil when he was 2 or 3 years old. His older brother Cliff told him that if he hadn\u2019t taken Johnnie and run away, then he would\u2019ve been dead.\n\nEleven years after his mother died, there\u2019s one mystery that Johnnie isn\u2019t sure he wants to solve. Johnnie Gilbert Harbaugh\u2019s birth certificate says he was born on Jan. 7, 1950 in Blytheville, Ark. That document, though, wasn\u2019t issued until May 29, 1957.\n\nThere are plenty of legitimate reasons to file for a delayed birth certificate\u2014it\u2019s possible that Johnnie\u2019s birth, in rural Arkansas, wasn\u2019t recorded right away. Johnnie Harbaugh\u2019s mother, though, once used just such a document as a means of deception: In the 1960s, she procured a delayed birth certificate to prove she was \u201cConstance Wakefield,\u201d Lawrence Wakefield\u2019s daughter.\n\nWhen he was a child, Johnnie says, he\u2019d see birth certificates just lying around the house. Is his own birth record a phony?\n\n\u201cI might have even been somebody else\u2019s kid,\u201d he says. \u201cShe might have grabbed me when I was a baby.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s likely he was stolen, that he belongs to someone else. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like that, even as a kid, even as far back as I can remember.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he says, he had several people back in Arkansas pull him aside and say they\u2019d tell him his life story one day\u2014who he is, and who his mother is. But those conversations have never happened. Now, most of the people who might know the truth are dead.\n\nAt one point, he tells me that none of it really matters. \u201cNot to me it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI got a last name, and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d Then he changes his mind, saying it might be nice to know the truth. Maybe his real parents are out there. Maybe they\u2019re good people. Maybe they miss their son. \u201cHey,\u201d he says hopefully, \u201cmaybe they\u2019re rich.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf09504235215b082e315"}}
