When they \u201chit the wall\u201d from the unrelenting pace, there is only one solution: \u201cClimb the wall,\u201d others reported. To be the best Amazonians they can be, they should be guided by the leadership principles, 14 rules inscribed on handy laminated cards. When quizzed days later, those with perfect scores earn a virtual award proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m Peculiar\u201d \u2014 the company\u2019s proud phrase for overturning workplace conventions.\n\nAt Amazon, workers are encouraged to tear apart one another\u2019s ideas in meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the company boasts are \u201cunreasonably high.\u201d The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another\u2019s bosses. Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: \u201cI felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the newcomers filing in on Mondays may not be there in a few years. The company\u2019s winners dream up innovations that they roll out to a quarter-billion customers and accrue small fortunes in soaring stock. Losers leave or are fired in annual cullings of the staff \u2014 \u201cpurposeful Darwinism,\u201d one former Amazon human resources director said. Some workers who suffered from cancer, miscarriages and other personal crises said they had been evaluated unfairly or edged out rather than given time to recover.\n\nEven as the company tests delivery by drone and ways to restock toilet paper at the push of a bathroom button, it is conducting a little-known experiment in how far it can push white-collar workers, redrawing the boundaries of what is acceptable. The company, founded and still run by Jeff Bezos, rejects many of the popular management bromides that other corporations at least pay lip service to and has instead designed what many workers call an intricate machine propelling them to achieve Mr. Bezos\u2019 ever-expanding ambitions.\n\n\u201cThis is a company that strives to do really big, innovative, groundbreaking things, and those things aren\u2019t easy,\u201d said Susan Harker, Amazon\u2019s top recruiter. \u201cWhen you\u2019re shooting for the moon, the nature of the work is really challenging. For some people it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBo Olson was one of them. He lasted less than two years in a book marketing role and said that his enduring image was watching people weep in the office, a sight other workers described as well. \u201cYou walk out of a conference room and you\u2019ll see a grown man covering his face,\u201d he said. \u201cNearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.\u201d\n\nThanks in part to its ability to extract the most from employees, Amazon is stronger than ever. Its swelling campus is transforming a swath of this city, a 10-million-square-foot bet that tens of thousands of new workers will be able to sell everything to everyone everywhere. Last month, it eclipsed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the country, with a market valuation of $250 billion, and Forbes deemed Mr. Bezos the fifth-wealthiest person on earth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTens of millions of Americans know Amazon as customers, but life inside its corporate offices is largely a mystery. Secrecy is required; even low-level employees sign a lengthy confidentiality agreement. The company authorized only a handful of senior managers to talk to reporters for this article, declining requests for interviews with Mr. Bezos and his top leaders.\n\nContinue reading the main story Bo Olson Worked in books marketing \u201cNearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.\u201d Bo Olson, worked in books marketing\n\nHowever, more than 100 current and former Amazonians \u2014 members of the leadership team, human resources executives, marketers, retail specialists and engineers who worked on projects from the Kindle to grocery delivery to the recent mobile phone launch \u2014 described how they tried to reconcile the sometimes-punishing aspects of their workplace with what many called its thrilling power to create.\n\nIn interviews, some said they thrived at Amazon precisely because it pushed them past what they thought were their limits. Many employees are motivated by \u201cthinking big and knowing that we haven\u2019t scratched the surface on what\u2019s out there to invent,\u201d said Elisabeth Rommel, a retail executive who was one of those permitted to speak.\n\nOthers who cycled in and out of the company said that what they learned in their brief stints helped their careers take off. And more than a few who fled said they later realized they had become addicted to Amazon\u2019s way of working.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who work there feel this tension: It\u2019s the greatest place I hate to work,\u201d said John Rossman, a former executive there who published a book, \u201cThe Amazon Way.\u201d\n\nContinue reading the main story Tony Galbato Amazon vice president of human resources \u201cIt would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.\u201d Tony Galbato, Amazon vice president for human resources\n\nAmazon may be singular but perhaps not quite as peculiar as it claims. It has just been quicker in responding to changes that the rest of the work world is now experiencing: data that allows individual performance to be measured continuously, come-and-go relationships between employers and employees, and global competition in which empires rise and fall overnight. Amazon is in the vanguard of where technology wants to take the modern office: more nimble and more productive, but harsher and less forgiving.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are turning up the dial, pushing their teams to do more for less money, either to keep up with the competition or just stay ahead of the executioner\u2019s blade,\u201d said Clay Parker Jones, a consultant who helps old-line businesses become more responsive to change.\n\nOn a recent morning, as Amazon\u2019s new hires waited to begin orientation, few of them seemed to appreciate the experiment in which they had enrolled. Only one, Keith Ketzle, a freckled Texan triathlete with an M.B.A., lit up with recognition, explaining how he left his old, lumbering company for a faster, grittier one.\n\n\u201cConflict brings about innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Philosophy of Work\n\nJeff Bezos turned to data-driven management very early.\n\nHe wanted his grandmother to stop smoking, he recalled in a 2010 graduation speech at Princeton. He didn\u2019t beg or appeal to sentiment. He just did the math, calculating that every puff cost her a few minutes. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken nine years off your life!\u201d he told her. She burst into tears.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was 10 at the time. Decades later, he created a technological and retail giant by relying on some of the same impulses: eagerness to tell others how to behave; an instinct for bluntness bordering on confrontation; and an overarching confidence in the power of metrics, buoyed by his experience in the early 1990s at D. E. Shaw, a financial firm that overturned Wall Street convention by using algorithms to get the most out of every trade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to early executives and employees, Mr. Bezos was determined almost from the moment he founded Amazon in 1994 to resist the forces he thought sapped businesses over time \u2014 bureaucracy, profligate spending, lack of rigor. As the company grew, he wanted to codify his ideas about the workplace, some of them proudly counterintuitive, into instructions simple enough for a new worker to understand, general enough to apply to the nearly limitless number of businesses he wanted to enter and stringent enough to stave off the mediocrity he feared.\n\nThe result was the leadership principles, the articles of faith that describe the way Amazonians should act. In contrast to companies where declarations about their philosophy amount to vague platitudes, Amazon has rules that are part of its daily language and rituals, used in hiring, cited at meetings and quoted in food-truck lines at lunchtime. Some Amazonians say they teach them to their children.\n\nThe guidelines conjure an empire of elite workers (principle No. 5: \u201cHire and develop the best\u201d) who hold one another to towering expectations and are liberated from the forces \u2014 red tape, office politics \u2014 that keep them from delivering their utmost. Employees are to exhibit \u201cownership\u201d (No. 2), or mastery of every element of their businesses, and \u201cdive deep,\u201d (No. 12) or find the underlying ideas that can fix problems or identify new services before shoppers even ask for them.\n\nThe workplace should be infused with transparency and precision about who is really achieving and who is not. Within Amazon, ideal employees are often described as \u201cathletes\u201d with endurance, speed (No. 8: \u201cbias for action\u201d), performance that can be measured and an ability to defy limits (No. 7: \u201cthink big\u201d).\n\n\u201cYou can work long, hard or smart, but at Amazon.com you can\u2019t choose two out of three,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in his 1997 letter to shareholders, when the company sold only books, and which still serves as a manifesto. He added that when he interviewed potential hires, he warned them, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to work here.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rossman, the former executive, said that Mr. Bezos was addressing a meeting in 2003 when he turned in the direction of Microsoft, across the water from Seattle, and said he didn\u2019t want Amazon to become \u201ca country club.\u201d If Amazon becomes like Microsoft, \u201cwe would die,\u201d Mr. Bezos added.\n\nWhile the Amazon campus appears similar to those of some tech giants \u2014 with its dog-friendly offices, work force that skews young and male, on-site farmers\u2019 market and upbeat posters \u2014 the company is considered a place apart. Google and Facebook motivate employees with gyms, meals and benefits, like cash handouts for new parents, \u201cdesigned to take care of the whole you,\u201d as Google puts it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmazon, though, offers no pretense that catering to employees is a priority. Compensation is considered competitive \u2014 successful midlevel managers can collect the equivalent of an extra salary from grants of a stock that has increased more than tenfold since 2008. But workers are expected to embrace \u201cfrugality\u201d (No. 9), from the bare-bones desks to the cellphones and travel expenses that they often pay themselves. (No daily free food buffets or regular snack supplies, either.) The focus is on relentless striving to please customers, or \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d (No. 1), with words like \u201cmission\u201d used to describe lightning-quick delivery of Cocoa Krispies or selfie sticks.\n\nAs the company has grown, Mr. Bezos has become more committed to his original ideas, viewing them in almost moral terms, those who have worked closely with him say. \u201cMy main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture,\u201d Mr. Bezos said last year at a conference run by Business Insider, a web publication in which he is an investor.\n\nOf all of his management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace \u2014 that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to \u201cdisagree and commit\u201d (No. 13) \u2014 to rip into colleagues\u2019 ideas, with feedback that can be blunt to the point of painful, before lining up behind a decision.\n\n\u201cWe always want to arrive at the right answer,\u201d said Tony Galbato, vice president for human resources, in an email statement. \u201cIt would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.\u201d\n\nAt its best, some employees said, Amazon can feel like the Bezos vision come to life, a place willing to embrace risk and strengthen ideas by stress test. Employees often say their co-workers are the sharpest, most committed colleagues they have ever met, taking to heart instructions in the leadership principles like \u201cnever settle\u201d and \u201cno task is beneath them.\u201d Even relatively junior employees can make major contributions. The new delivery-by-drone project announced in 2013, for example, was coinvented by a low-level engineer named Daniel Buchmueller.\n\nContinue reading the main story Dina Vaccari Worked at Amazon from 2008 to 2014, on projects from corporate gift cards to sales of scientific supplies. \u201cI was so addicted to wanting to be successful there. For those of us who went to work there, it was like a drug that we could get self-worth from.\u201d Dina Vaccari worked on projects from corporate gift cards to sales of scientific supplies, 2008 to 2014.\n\nLast August, Stephenie Landry, an operations executive, joined in discussions about how to shorten delivery times and developed an idea for rushing goods to urban customers in an hour or less. One hundred eleven days later, she was in Brooklyn directing the start of the new service, Prime Now.\n\n\u201cA customer was able to get an Elsa doll that they could not find in all of New York City, and they had it delivered to their house in 23 minutes,\u201d said Ms. Landry, who was authorized by the company to speak, still sounding exhilarated months later about providing \u201cFrozen\u201d dolls in record time.\n\nThat becomes possible, she and others said, when everyone follows the dictates of the leadership principles. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create those moments for customers where we\u2019re solving a really practical need,\u201d Ms. Landry said, \u201cin this way that feels really futuristic and magical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMotivating the \u2018Amabots\u2019\n\nCompany veterans often say the genius of Amazon is the way it drives them to drive themselves. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good Amazonian, you become an Amabot,\u201d said one employee, using a term that means you have become at one with the system.\n\nIn Amazon warehouses, employees are monitored by sophisticated electronic systems to ensure they are packing enough boxes every hour. (Amazon came under fire in 2011 when workers in an eastern Pennsylvania warehouse toiled in more than 100-degree heat with ambulances waiting outside, taking away laborers as they fell. After an investigation by the local newspaper, the company installed air-conditioning.)\n\nBut in its offices, Amazon uses a self-reinforcing set of management, data and psychological tools to spur its tens of thousands of white-collar employees to do more and more. \u201cThe company is running a continual performance improvement algorithm on its staff,\u201d said Amy Michaels, a former Kindle marketer.\n\nThe process begins when Amazon\u2019s legions of recruiters identify thousands of job prospects each year, who face extra screening by \u201cbar raisers,\u201d star employees and part-time interviewers charged with ensuring that only the best are hired. As the newcomers acclimate, they often feel dazzled, flattered and intimidated by how much responsibility the company puts on their shoulders and how directly Amazon links their performance to the success of their assigned projects, whether selling wine or testing the delivery of packages straight to shoppers\u2019 car trunks.\n\nContinue reading the main story Amy Michaels Worked in advertising and marketing at Amazon from 2012 to 2014. \u201cWhen you have so much turnover, the risk is that people are seen as fungible. You know that tomorrow you\u2019re going to look around and some people are going to have left the company or been managed out.\u201d Amy Michaels worked in advertising and marketing, 2012-2014.\n\nEvery aspect of the Amazon system amplifies the others to motivate and discipline the company\u2019s marketers, engineers and finance specialists: the leadership principles; rigorous, continuing feedback on performance; and the competition among peers who fear missing a potential problem or improvement and race to answer an email before anyone else.\n\nSome veterans interviewed said they were protected from pressures by nurturing bosses or worked in relatively slow divisions. But many others said the culture stoked their willingness to erode work-life boundaries, castigate themselves for shortcomings (being \u201cvocally self-critical\u201d is included in the description of the leadership principles) and try to impress a company that can often feel like an insatiable taskmaster. Even many Amazonians who have worked on Wall Street and at start-ups say the workloads at the new South Lake Union campus can be extreme: marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.\n\n\u201cOne time I didn\u2019t sleep for four days straight,\u201d said Dina Vaccari, who joined in 2008 to sell Amazon gift cards to other companies and once used her own money, without asking for approval, to pay a freelancer in India to enter data so she could get more done. \u201cThese businesses were my babies, and I did whatever I could to make them successful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe and other workers had no shortage of career options but said they had internalized Amazon\u2019s priorities. One ex-employee\u2019s fianc\u00e9 became so concerned about her nonstop working night after night that he would drive to the Amazon campus at 10 p.m. and dial her cellphone until she agreed to come home. When they took a vacation to Florida, she spent every day at Starbucks using the wireless connection to get work done.\n\nContinue reading the main story Liz Pearce Helped start Amazon\u2019s wedding registry \u201cI would see people practically combust.\u201d Liz Pearce, worked on Amazon\u2019s wedding registry\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the ulcer started,\u201d she said. (Like several other former workers, the woman requested that her name not be used because her current company does business with Amazon. Some current employees were reluctant to be identified because they were barred from speaking with reporters.)\n\nTo prod employees, Amazon has a powerful lever: more data than any retail operation in history. Its perpetual flow of real-time, ultradetailed metrics allows the company to measure nearly everything its customers do: what they put in their shopping carts, but do not buy; when readers reach the \u201cabandon point\u201d in a Kindle book; and what they will stream based on previous purchases. It can also tell when engineers are not building pages that load quickly enough, or when a vendor manager does not have enough gardening gloves in stock.\n\n\u201cData creates a lot of clarity around decision-making,\u201d said Sean Boyle, who runs the finance division of Amazon Web Services and was permitted by the company to speak. \u201cData is incredibly liberating.\u201d\n\nAmazon employees are held accountable for a staggering array of metrics, a process that unfolds in what can be anxiety-provoking sessions called business reviews, held weekly or monthly among various teams. A day or two before the meetings, employees receive printouts, sometimes up to 50 or 60 pages long, several workers said. At the reviews, employees are cold-called and pop-quizzed on any one of those thousands of numbers.\n\nExplanations like \u201cwe\u2019re not totally sure\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you\u201d are not acceptable, many employees said. Some managers sometimes dismissed such responses as \u201cstupid\u201d or told workers to \u201cjust stop it.\u201d The toughest questions are often about getting to the bottom of \u201ccold pricklies,\u201d or email notifications that inform shoppers that their goods won\u2019t arrive when promised \u2014 the opposite of the \u201cwarm fuzzy\u201d sensation of consumer satisfaction.\n\nThe sessions crowd out other work, many workers complain. But they also say that is part of the point: The meetings force them to absorb the metrics of their business, their minds swimming with details.\n\nContinue reading the main story Stephanie Landry tk \u201cThere\u2019s no reward for not speaking up. \u2018Good backbone\u2019 is a compliment. It\u2019s a very seductive quality about the organization because people want to contribute.\u201d Stephenie Landry has worked on projects from grocery delivery to sales of books and baby gear since 2004.\n\n\u201cOnce you know something isn\u2019t as good as it could be, why wouldn\u2019t you want to fix it?\u201d said Julie Todaro, who led some of Amazon\u2019s largest retail categories.\n\nEmployees talk of feeling how their work is never done or good enough. One Amazon building complex is named Day 1, a reminder from Mr. Bezos that it is only the beginning of a new era of commerce, with much more to accomplish.\n\nIn 2012, Chris Brucia, who was working on a new fashion sale site, received a punishing performance review from his boss, a half-hour lecture on every goal he had not fulfilled and every skill he had not yet mastered. Mr. Brucia silently absorbed the criticism, fearing he was about to be managed out, wondering how he would tell his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re being promoted,\u201d his boss finished, leaning in for a hug that Mr. Brucia said he was too shocked to return.\n\nNoelle Barnes, who worked in marketing for Amazon for nine years, repeated a saying around campus: \u201cAmazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves.\u201d\n\nA Running Competition\n\nIn 2013, Elizabeth Willet, a former Army captain who served in Iraq, joined Amazon to manage housewares vendors and was thrilled to find that a large company could feel so energetic and entrepreneurial. After she had a child, she arranged with her boss to be in the office from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day, pick up her baby and often return to her laptop later. Her boss assured her things were going well, but her colleagues, who did not see how early she arrived, sent him negative feedback accusing her of leaving too soon.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand here and defend you if your peers are saying you\u2019re not doing your work,\u201d she says he told her. She left the company after a little more than a year.\n\nMs. Willet\u2019s co-workers strafed her through the Anytime Feedback Tool, the widget in the company directory that allows employees to send praise or criticism about colleagues to management. (While bosses know who sends the comments, their identities are not typically shared with the subjects of the remarks.) Because team members are ranked, and those at the bottom eliminated every year, it is in everyone\u2019s interest to outperform everyone else.\n\nCraig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, said the tool was just another way to provide feedback, like sending an email or walking into a manager\u2019s office. Most comments, he said, are positive.\n\nHowever, many workers called it a river of intrigue and scheming. They described making quiet pacts with colleagues to bury the same person at once, or to praise one another lavishly. Many others, along with Ms. Willet, described feeling sabotaged by negative comments from unidentified colleagues with whom they could not argue. In some cases, the criticism was copied directly into their performance reviews \u2014 a move that Amy Michaels, the former Kindle manager, said that colleagues called \u201cthe full paste.\u201d\n\nSoon the tool, or something close, may be found in many more offices. Workday, a human resources software company, makes a similar product called Collaborative Anytime Feedback that promises to turn the annual performance review into a daily event. One of the early backers of Workday was Jeff Bezos, in one of his many investments. (He also owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe rivalries at Amazon extend beyond behind-the-back comments. Employees say that the Bezos ideal, a meritocracy in which people and ideas compete and the best win, where co-workers challenge one another \u201ceven when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting,\u201d as the leadership principles note, has turned into a world of frequent combat.\n\nContinue reading the main story David Loftesness tk \u201cYou can feel comfortable that if there\u2019s a flaw in your plan someone will tell you to your face.\u201d David Loftesness worked as a developer and manager on Amazon\u2019s internal search capabilities, 2003-2006.\n\nResources are sometimes hoarded. That includes promising job candidates, who are especially precious at a company with a high number of open positions. To get new team members, one veteran said, sometimes \u201cyou drown someone in the deep end of the pool,\u201d then take his or her subordinates. Ideas are critiqued so harshly in meetings at times that some workers fear speaking up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDavid Loftesness, a senior developer, said he admired the customer focus but could not tolerate the hostile language used in many meetings, a comment echoed by many others.\n\nFor years, he and his team devoted themselves to improving the search capabilities of Amazon\u2019s website \u2014 only to discover that Mr. Bezos had greenlighted a secret competing effort to build an alternate technology. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the kind of person who can work in this environment,\u201d he said he concluded. He went on to become a director of engineering at Twitter.\n\nEach year, the internal competition culminates at an extended semi-open tournament called an Organization Level Review, where managers debate subordinates\u2019 rankings, assigning and reassigning names to boxes in a matrix projected on the wall. In recent years, other large companies, including Microsoft, General Electric and Accenture Consulting, have dropped the practice \u2014 often called stack ranking, or \u201crank and yank\u201d \u2014 in part because it can force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas.\n\nThe review meeting starts with a discussion of the lower-level employees, whose performance is debated in front of higher-level managers. As the hours pass, successive rounds of managers leave the room, knowing that those who remain will determine their fates.\n\nPreparing is like getting ready for a court case, many supervisors say: To avoid losing good members of their teams \u2014 which could spell doom \u2014 they must come armed with paper trails to defend the wrongfully accused and incriminate members of competing groups. Or they adopt a strategy of choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players. \u201cYou learn how to diplomatically throw people under the bus,\u201d said a marketer who spent six years in the retail division. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Galbato, the human resources executive, explained the company\u2019s reasoning for the annual staff paring. \u201cWe hire a lot of great people,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cbut we don\u2019t always get it right.\u201d\n\nDick Finnegan, a consultant who advises companies on how to retain employees, warns of the costs of mandatory cuts. \u201cIf you can build an organization with zero deadwood, why wouldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how sustainable it is. You\u2019d have to have a never-ending two-mile line around the block of very qualified people who want to work for you.\u201d\n\nMany women at Amazon attribute its gender gap \u2014 unlike Facebook, Google or Walmart, it does not currently have a single woman on its top leadership team \u2014 to its competition-and-elimination system. Several former high-level female executives, and other women participating in a recent internal Amazon online discussion that was shared with The New York Times, said they believed that some of the leadership principles worked to their disadvantage. They said they could lose out in promotions because of intangible criteria like \u201cearn trust\u201d (principle No. 10) or the emphasis on disagreeing with colleagues. Being too forceful, they said, can be particularly hazardous for women in the workplace.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMotherhood can also be a liability. Michelle Williamson, a 41-year-old parent of three who helped build Amazon\u2019s restaurant supply business, said her boss, Shahrul Ladue, had told her that raising children would most likely prevent her from success at a higher level because of the long hours required. Mr. Ladue, who confirmed her account, said that Ms. Williamson had been directly competing with younger colleagues with fewer commitments, so he suggested she find a less demanding job at Amazon. (Both he and Ms. Williamson left the company.)\n\nHe added that he usually worked 85 or more hours a week and rarely took a vacation.\n\nWhen \u2018All\u2019 Isn\u2019t Good Enough\n\nMolly Jay, an early member of the Kindle team, said she received high ratings for years. But when she began traveling to care for her father, who was suffering from cancer, and cut back working on nights and weekends, her status changed. She was blocked from transferring to a less pressure-filled job, she said, and her boss told her she was \u201ca problem.\u201d As her father was dying, she took unpaid leave to care for him and never returned to Amazon.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not able to give your absolute all, 80 hours a week, they see it as a major weakness,\u201d she said.\n\nA woman who had thyroid cancer was given a low performance rating after she returned from treatment. She says her manager explained that while she was out, her peers were accomplishing a great deal. Another employee who miscarried twins left for a business trip the day after she had surgery. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the work is still going to need to get done,\u201d she said her boss told her. \u201cFrom where you are in life, trying to start a family, I don\u2019t know if this is the right place for you.\u201d\n\nA woman who had breast cancer was told that she was put on a \u201cperformance improvement plan\u201d \u2014 Amazon code for \u201cyou\u2019re in danger of being fired\u201d \u2014 because \u201cdifficulties\u201d in her \u201cpersonal life\u201d had interfered with fulfilling her work goals. Their accounts echoed others from workers who had suffered health crises and felt they had also been judged harshly instead of being given time to recover.\n\nA former human resources executive said she was required to put a woman who had recently returned after undergoing serious surgery, and another who had just had a stillborn child, on performance improvement plans, accounts that were corroborated by a co-worker still at Amazon. \u201cWhat kind of company do we want to be?\u201d the executive recalled asking her bosses.\n\nThe mother of the stillborn child soon left Amazon. \u201cI had just experienced the most devastating event in my life,\u201d the woman recalled via email, only to be told her performance would be monitored \u201cto make sure my focus stayed on my job.\u201d\n\nContinue reading the main story Jason Merkoski Worked at Amazon from 2007-2012, on projects from software sales to launching a new flash-sale site. \u201cThe joke in the office was that when it came to work/life balance, work came first, life came second, and trying to find the balance came last.\u201d Jason Merkoski worked on projects including Kindle and the Fire TV device. Employed at Amazon 2006 to 2010, then again in 2014.\n\nMr. Berman, the spokesman, said such responses to employees\u2019 crises were \u201cnot our policy or practice.\u201d He added, \u201cIf we were to become aware of anything like that, we would take swift action to correct it.\u201d Amazon also made Ms. Harker, the top recruiter, available to describe the leadership team\u2019s strong support over the last two years as her husband battled a rare cancer. \u201cIt took my breath away,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral employment lawyers in the Seattle area said they got regular calls from Amazon workers complaining of unfair treatment, including those who said they had been pushed out for \u201cnot being sufficiently devoted to the company,\u201d said Michael Subit. But that is not a basis for a suit by itself, he said. \u201cUnfairness is not illegal,\u201d echoed Sara Amies, another lawyer. Without clear evidence of discrimination, it is difficult to win a suit based on a negative evaluation, she said.\n\nFor all of the employees who are edged out, many others flee, exhausted or unwilling to further endure the hardships for the cause of delivering swim goggles and rolls of Scotch tape to customers just a little quicker.\n\nJason Merkoski, 42, an engineer, worked on the team developing the first Kindle e-reader and served as a technology evangelist for Amazon, traveling the world to learn how people used the technology so it could be improved. He left Amazon in 2010 and then returned briefly in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of innovations means things go wrong, you need to rectify, and then explain, and heaven help if you got an email from Jeff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you\u2019ve got the C.E.O. of the company in bed with you at 3 a.m. breathing down your neck.\u201d\n\nA Stream of Departures\n\nAmazon retains new workers in part by requiring them to repay a part of their signing bonus if they leave within a year, and a portion of their hefty relocation fees if they leave within two years. Several fathers said they left or were considering quitting because of pressure from bosses or peers to spend less time with their families. (Many tech companies are racing to top one another\u2019s family leave policies \u2014 Netflix just began offering up to a year of paid parental leave. Amazon, though, offers no paid paternity leave.)\n\nIn interviews, 40-year-old men were convinced Amazon would replace them with 30-year-olds who could put in more hours, and 30-year-olds were sure that the company preferred to hire 20-somethings who would outwork them. After Max Shipley, a father of two young children, left this spring, he wondered if Amazon would \u201cbring in college kids who have fewer commitments, who are single, who have more time to focus on work.\u201d Mr. Shipley is 25.\n\nAmazon insists its reputation for high attrition is misleading. A 2013 survey by PayScale, a salary analysis firm, put the median employee tenure at one year, among the briefest in the Fortune 500. Amazon officials insisted tenure was low because hiring was so robust, adding that only 15 percent of employees had been at the company more than five years. Turnover is consistent with others in the technology industry, they said, but declined to disclose any data.\n\nContinue reading the main story Chris Brucia Worked at Amazon from 2007-2012, on projects from software sales to launching a new flash-sale site. \u201cWorking at Amazon can be a bit of an acquired taste, because everyone has a different need for positive reinforcement. It was hard to feel like the work we were doing was satisfactory. There are not a lot of people that last even as long as I stayed.\u201d Chris Brucia worked at Amazon from 2005-2012, on projects from software sales to launching a new flash-sale site.\n\nEmployees, human resources executives and recruiters describe a steady exodus. \u201cThe pattern of burn and churn at Amazon, resulting in a disproportionate number of candidates from Amazon showing at our doorstep, is clear and consistent,\u201d Nimrod Hoofien, a director of engineering at Facebook and an Amazon veteran, said in a recent Facebook post.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose departures are not a failure of the system, many current and former employees say, but rather the logical conclusion: mass intake of new workers, who help the Amazon machine spin and then wear out, leaving the most committed Amazonians to survive.\n\n\u201cPurposeful Darwinism,\u201d Robin Andrulevich, a former top Amazon human resources executive who helped draft the Leadership Principles, posted in reply to Mr. Hoofien\u2019s comment. \u201cThey never could have done what they\u2019ve accomplished without that,\u201d she said in an interview, referring to Amazon\u2019s cycle of constantly hiring employees, driving them and cutting them.\n\n\u201cAmazon is O.K. with moving through a lot of people to identify and retain superstars,\u201d said Vijay Ravindran, who worked at the retailer for seven years, the last two as the manager overseeing the checkout technology. \u201cThey keep the stars by offering a combination of incredible opportunities and incredible compensation. It\u2019s like panning for gold.\u201d\n\nThe employees who stream from the Amazon exits are highly desirable because of their work ethic, local recruiters say. In recent years, companies like Facebook have opened large Seattle offices, and they benefit from the Amazon outflow.\n\nRecruiters, though, also say that other businesses are sometimes cautious about bringing in Amazon workers, because they have been trained to be so combative. The derisive local nickname for Amazon employees is \u201cAmholes\u201d \u2014 pugnacious and work-obsessed.\n\nCall them what you will, their ranks are rapidly increasing. Amazon is finishing a 37-floor office tower near its South Lake Union campus and building another tower next to it. It plans a third next to that and has space for two more high-rises. By the time the dust settles in three years, Amazon will have enough space for 50,000 employees or so, more than triple what it had as recently as 2013.\n\nThose new workers will strive to make Amazon the first trillion-dollar retailer, in the hope that just about everyone will be watching Amazon movies and playing Amazon games on Amazon tablets while they tell their Amazon Echo communications device that they need an Amazon-approved plumber and new lawn chairs, and throw in some Amazon potato chips as well.\n\nMaybe it will happen. Liz Pearce spent two years at Amazon, managing projects like its wedding registry. \u201cThe pressure to deliver far surpasses any other metric,\u201d she said. \u201cI would see people practically combust.\u201d\n\nBut just as Jeff Bezos was able to see the future of e-commerce before anyone else, she added, he was able to envision a new kind of workplace: fluid but tough, with employees staying only a short time and employers demanding the maximum.\n\n\u201cAmazon is driven by data,\u201d said Ms. Pearce, who now runs her own Seattle software company, which is well stocked with ex-Amazonians. \u201cIt will only change if the data says it must \u2014 when the entire way of hiring and working and firing stops making economic sense.\u201d\n\nThe retailer is already showing some strain from its rapid growth. Even for entry-level jobs, it is hiring on the East Coast, and many employees are required to hand over all their contacts to company recruiters at \u201cLinkedIn\u201d parties. In Seattle alone, more than 4,500 jobs are open, including one for an analyst specializing in \u201chigh-volume hiring.\u201d\n\nSome companies, faced with such an overwhelming need for new bodies, might scale back their ambitions or soften their message.\n\nNot Amazon. In a recent recruiting video, one young woman warns: \u201cYou either fit here or you don\u2019t. You love it or you don\u2019t. There is no middle ground.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf2b204235215b082e45e"}}
