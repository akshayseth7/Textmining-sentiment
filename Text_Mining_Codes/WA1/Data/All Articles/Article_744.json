For those of us left unexposed, the hacking has given us more questions than answers. Questions like: Is my husband on here? What about my ex-boyfriend? And my dad? Should I enter all of their email addresses into this frustratingly convenient website that tells you if it\u2019s associated with an Ashley Madison account, just in case? Those questions, and more, answered:\n\nAmanda Hess Amanda Hess is a Slate staff writer.\n\nWhy did the hackers do this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAshley Madison believes that Impact Team, the anonymous hacking collective that\u2019s claimed responsibility for the leak, is an ideologically driven group that wants to impose its \u201cpersonal notion of virtue on all of society.\u201d Impact Team says it targeted Ashley Madison because the site charges users a fee to delete their full message history and retains data on customers after they leave. Still, it\u2019s not all about privacy; there seems to be a chivalrous bent to Impact Team\u2019s crusade. Ashley Madison\u2019s parent company, Avid Life Media, also owns taboo dating sites Established Men (\u201cConnecting young, beautiful women with interesting men\u201d) and Cougar Life (\u201cMeet Divorcees, Single Moms, and Sexy Singles looking for a young Stud!\u201d). The hackers included Established Men users in the Ashley Madison leak, but they left the cougars alone. On Twitter, BuzzFeed\u2019s Katie Notopolous noted that this is the rare sex-related hack to predominantly target men. This is a smart move: After last year\u2019s leak of female celebrity nude photos sparked a feminist backlash, a hacker who hopes to discredit and embarrass his target may find that shaming women causes his plan to backfire. So while women constitute a healthy minority of Ashley Madison users, Impact Team has made an effort to recuse them from the public shaming ritual. In fact, in a statement posted with the leak, the hackers suggested that women who turn up in the database are probably just one of the site\u2019s many \u201cfake female profiles.\u201d It didn\u2019t let the men off so easily: \u201cChances are your husband signed up for the world\u2019s biggest affair site, but never had one. He just tried to. If that distinction matters.\u201d\n\nDoes that distinction matter?\n\nWhat constitutes cheating varies from couple to couple, but I think most Americans would agree that entering an email address into a website and making genital contact with another human being are different things.\n\nHow do Ashley Madison users feel about the leak?\n\nI created a profile this morning, uploaded a photo, used Ashley Madison\u2019s photo-editing software to place a fun Eyes Wide Shut mask graphic over my face, and tooled around the site looking for the cheaters to share their feelings. I admitted to being a journalist on assignment in my profile, and nobody agreed to talk to me, but one of them did send me a photograph of his penis. I can confidently report that many users\u2019 activities have not been affected by the leak.\n\nHow should I feel about the leak?", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf22b04235215b082e43f"}}
