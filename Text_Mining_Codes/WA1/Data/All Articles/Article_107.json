Advocates of gay rights and free speech have been feeling that singular grief due to a spate of well-meaning but wrongheaded court rulings upholding the constitutionality of ex-gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d bans. According to these rulings, such bans aren\u2019t really speech at all, but simply \u201cconduct.\u201d Thus, they fall outside the protections of the First Amendment and don\u2019t implicate any free speech concerns.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nBut on Thursday, a unanimous panel on the 3rd Circuit put the kibosh on this ill-starred line of reasoning, upholding New Jersey\u2019s gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d ban under a very different rationale. In an opinion by George W. Bush appointee D. Brooks Smith, the court held that, in fact, talk therapy by medical professionals is indeed a form of speech, not mere \u201cconduct.\u201d Because the speech occurs in the heavily regulated setting of doctor-patient treatment, however, therapists\u2019 First Amendment protections are somewhat diminished. The state, after all, has an interest in protecting patients from harmful medical care, whether that care comes in the form of surgery or speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBalancing all these complex interests, the court decided that New Jersey\u2019s desire to protect gay people from harmful quackery outweighs those therapists\u2019 free speech rights. In reaching this conclusion, the court used a test not unlike the one I suggested last year. A restriction on professional speech, the court held, is valid so long as it \u201cdirectly advances the state\u2019s substantial interest\u201d in protecting citizens from harm and is \u201cno more extensive than necessary.\u201d The application of this test here is easy: Gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d can trigger depression and suicide, and New Jersey\u2019s ban merely revokes the license of any professional who practices it. Accordingly, the law passes First Amendment muster.\n\nAt first blush, it might not seem particularly important what reasoning courts use to strike down gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d restrictions. But the test courts use here could have significant implications in other contexts. Just this summer, a divided panel on the 11th Circuit used the \u201cconduct\u201d rationale to uphold a savage, cynical Florida law that forbids doctors from giving their patients advice about gun safety. Because the censorship in question took place in the doctor\u2019s office, the court explained, it was just a reasonable \u201cregulation of professional conduct,\u201d not a free speech violation. Under the 3rd Circuit\u2019s test, Florida\u2019s statute would almost certainly fall; the state has no \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in protecting citizens from a gentle inquiry about firearms, and the absurdly broad law gags doctors from even broaching the topic.\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has declined to weigh in and clarify the appropriate constitutional test for ex-gay conversion \u201ctherapy\u201d bans. But if they do, the conservative justices will be bound by some precedent that they would probably prefer to ignore. Prior to the current quarrels over guns and gays, the question of medical censorship really only came up in one context: abortion. In the early 1990s, the court heard several cases in which doctors claimed they had a First Amendment right not to peddle a state\u2019s anti-abortion message to their patients. Each time, the conservative justices waved away these concerns, suggesting (almost offhandedly) that the state had a rational interest in regulating doctors\u2019 professional activity.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee8604235215b082e1c1"}}
