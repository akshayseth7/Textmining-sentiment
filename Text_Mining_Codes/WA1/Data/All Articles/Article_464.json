This might seem a less-than-noteworthy development. One assumes Trump wore the hat mostly just to corral his cotton-candy hair on a windy day. Yet the online reaction was swift and torrential.\n\nSome wondered why a man worth more than TEN BILLION DOLLARS chose a hat that looked to cost about $5.99. Many others, meanwhile, wondered where they could buy one for themselves. The Trump campaign store in Manhattan sold out of the hat within hours, and his website scrambled to make them available for order. One online retailer rushed to fill the void with a line of knockoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhy did the donning of casual headwear become a subject of national fascination? It helps that The Donald is piping hot at the moment, a figure who spurs endless curiosity. Everything he touches turns to tweets. And oh, that photo: the pursed-lipped, squinty-eyed Trump frowning under his new chapeau. Juxtapose almost anything with Trump\u2019s sour puss, and you\u2019ve got yourself an indelible image.\n\nBut the fuss was in large part about the hat qua hat. Its text, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u2014a shameless rip-off of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign slogan \u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again.\u201d (Note how Trump tweaks it to be both less inclusive and more bossy.) The hat\u2019s foamy front\u2014apparently made from a repurposed beer koozie. The double divots framing the central peak. And of course the braided rope that elegantly stretched across its brim.\n\nThe \u201crope hat\u201d style is on trend these days. Gnarly skateboard periodical Thrasher Magazine sells them in several colors, highlighting\u2014in rather Trumpian language\u2014the \u201cclassy woven rope\u201d that distinguishes its design. Urban Outfitters offers a circa 1992 Wu-Tang rope hat. Vintage rope hats routinely show up on Etsy. In June, a bit more than a month before Trump wore one for the cameras, Golf Digest asked, \u201cAre rope hats back to being cool?\u201d after one appeared atop the head of 26-year-old PGA tour pro Harris English. This was no mere trucker hat. The rope is a distinctive touch.\n\nThe hat is random and startling, and so is the Donald.\n\nThere\u2019s a fine line here between retro chic and just, like, dorky 9-hole golf course wear. But Trump manages to walk this tightrope with ease. He\u2019s got that quirky, aging rich guy cool\u2014the same kind that turned grandfatherly, 74-year-old Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s fetish for Nike Lunar Force 1 sneakers into a minisensation in New England last year.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of the hat\u2019s lettering. Rendering Trump\u2019s slogan in all caps may actually reduce its legibility, since the lack of shape contrast slows down readers. But so what? \u201cDonald Trump is an all-caps kind of guy,\u201d says Steven Heller. Heller, co-chair of the MFA in design at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, recently analyzed Trump\u2019s typography choices for Wired\u2014beginning with the giant, brass-colored, \u201cTRUMP TOWER\u201d sign over the entry of Trump\u2019s flagship Fifth Avenue building. Heller notes that the sign\u2019s typeface, a slab serif style that is likely either Stymie Bold or Lubalin Graph, is very similar to the one Playboy used for its gentlemen\u2019s clubs in the 1960s. Classy. Luxurious. Heller authored Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State, so he is an authority when he describes the all-caps, chunky serif aesthetic of the hat as \u201cimperial.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a hat on sale in the Hillary campaign shop that nicely highlights the differences between the two candidates. The Hillary hat has a complicated stitching pattern and colorful underbrim and looks like it was lovingly designed by professional milliners. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked the Trump campaign for their hat\u2019s origin story, and they\u2019ve not yet gotten back to me with an answer, but to my eyes the Trump hat looks to have been thrown together last-second by a frazzled intern. Which seems par for the course. Everything about Hillary screams \u201ccareful preparation\u201d while everything about Trump screams \u201cwinging it.\u201d\n\nJerry McLaughlin, co-founder of Branders.com, spent 15 years making merchandise for political campaigns. In his eyes, the purpose of all this swag is not for the campaign to make money. \u201cGenerally, they might end up making a few bucks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is not a meaningful source of revenue for them. It\u2019s not a commercial enterprise. It\u2019s more, \u2018Let\u2019s not lose money doing this.\u2019 \u201d Even the Obama campaign\u2019s reported $40 million revenue from its high-fashion 2012 merchandise line was a drop in the bucket, to McLaughlin\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s still small numbers compared to the billion dollars it takes to run a presidential campaign.\u201d And that\u2019s when you have Anna Wintour shaping your products.\n\nSurprisingly, McLaughlin doesn\u2019t even consider campaign merch a form of advertising. He doesn\u2019t think seeing a Hillary hat on someone else\u2019s head will turn you into a Hillary voter. \u201cIt\u2019s more that it cements the wearer closely to the candidate,\u201d he argues. \u201cI wear your hat and, because I\u2019ve announced publicly my affiliation with you, I find myself more committed. I\u2019ll take more actions on behalf of you. Subconsciously, by wearing the gear, we get ourselves more deeply involved.\u201d This is key when it comes to squeezing more volunteer work out of supporters or further donations as the election approaches.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0a104235215b082e327"}}
