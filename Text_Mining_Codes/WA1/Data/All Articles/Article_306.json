They\u2019re happening at the same time, but these two storms will likely produce very different outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThough Danny is currently much stronger, Kilo is quickly becoming the greater threat. Kilo could be the first hurricane to make landfall in Hawaii since 1992, when Category 4 Iniki devastated Kauai. Current models are still fairly unsure of Kilo\u2019s exact path, but universally suggest that it will be strengthening on its closest approach to Hawaii. El Ni\u00f1o will give Kilo a significant boost: Water temperatures in the vicinity of Hawaii are near an all-time record.\n\nLast year, Hawaii faced three separate tropical cyclone threats, including Iselle, the first tropical storm to make landfall on the Big Island in recorded history. This rare burst of activity has spilled over to a second year, boosted by the abnormally warm Pacific.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Danny\u2014the first Atlantic hurricane of the season\u2014reached Category 3 strength on Friday. But by Friday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center noted that Danny had likely peaked in intensity.\n\nNOAA Aircraft Operations Center\n\nAt the moment, the diminutive Danny packs sustained winds of 115 mph near its center, but should weaken considerably before its close brush with the northeast Caribbean islands early next week. Hurricanes as small in size as Danny are known for quick fluctuations in strength, and Danny has already topped official forecasts.\n\nDanny should be reduced to a tropical storm by the time it reaches Puerto Rico\u2014and could wind up being a nearly perfect salve for the commonwealth's crushing drought.\n\n#HurricaneDanny Keeping an eye on you from @space_station.

Florida, especially, should keep an eye on Danny\u2019s progress, though it\u2019s still much too soon to know where exactly the storm will track after it leaves the Caribbean late next week. Anywhere from Texas to Maine is currently within the realm of possibility, with Danny arriving at anything from hurricane strength to a glorified afternoon rain shower.\n\nA quick look at storms historically similar to Danny, as the Washington Post\u2019s Brian McNoldy has done below, highlights the reason why the eastern U.S. should keep an eye on it over the coming days.\n\nPast August storms that passed within 200 mi of Danny's location & forecast positions http://t.co/RmHH8UvKQ2 pic.twitter.com/WfS4h8ipvB \u2014 Brian McNoldy (@BMcNoldy) August 21, 2015", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeff604235215b082e289"}}
