The site is in the Marias Pass area of lower Mount Sharp. The scene combines dozens of images taken by Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on Aug 5, 2015, during the 1,065th Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars. The 92 component images are among MAHLI Sol 1065 raw images. For scale, the rover's wheels are 50cm in diameter and about 40cm wide.\n\nPHOTO : AFP / NASA / JPL-CALTECH / MSSS", "_id": {"$oid": "55dc245504235215b082e4e6"}}
