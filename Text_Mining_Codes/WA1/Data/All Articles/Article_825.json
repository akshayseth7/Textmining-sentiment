Shaye Haver, an Apache attack helicopter pilot who on Friday will be one of the first women to graduate from the Army\u2019s elite Ranger School, wants to remain an aviator. But she takes away weighty lessons from her grueling Ranger training: \u201cYour mind can take a whole lot more than your body,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think I would be crazy to say\u201d that the thought of quitting never occurred, she said on Thursday in her first public appearance since completing the exhausting nine-week course of little sleep and constant hiking with backpacks, water, weapons and other gear that weighed more than 100 pounds. But, Lieutenant Haver said, \u201cthe ability to look around to my peers and see that they were sucking just as bad as I was kept me going.\u201d\n\nThe other woman poised to make history by graduating Friday, Capt. Kristen Griest, said that if the Army ever allowed women to take the final step into combat, she may want to join the Special Forces. Captain Griest admitted she felt \u201cinternal pressure\u201d over how her performance could affect future opportunities for women.\n\nContinue reading the main story Video\n\nYet she said their accomplishment showed \u201cwhat they can expect from women in the military, that we can handle things physically and mentally on the same level as men, and that we can deal with the same stresses and training.\u201d\n\nAnd Captain Griest was blunt about what should never happen: \u201cNo woman that I know wants to go to Ranger School if they change the standards, because then it degrades\u201d the designation, she said.\n\nThe appearance of Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver here on Thursday, showcased by the Army, was a signal moment in the history of integrating women in the military, one bound to have an effect on the looming decisions about what military roles should be open to women and which, if any, should remain closed.\n\nNow, after two years of study, the heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines will make recommendations to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter in September, military officials said. At that time, the services can request exceptions to the overall directive to open positions to women and specify which positions and units they want to keep closed, and why.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Carter reiterated the Pentagon\u2019s position that \u201call ground combat positions will be open to women unless rigorous analysis\u201d from the services gives a compelling reason they should not be gender-neutral. Decisions are expected around the New Year.\n\nHe welcomed the graduation of the female Rangers. \u201cLike every Ranger fighting today,\u201d Mr. Carter said, \u201cthey will help lead the finest fighting force in the world.\u201d But for many military women, the graduation ceremony is the ultimate confirmation that there should be no limits on what women can achieve.\n\n\u201cI have an idea our Ranger sisters have no idea that we\u2019re all coming down here to see them graduate,\u201d said Donna McAleer, a 1987 graduate of West Point, said Thursday morning, just after she had made a red-eye flight to Columbus, Ga., from Salt Lake City. Ms. McAleer, who wrote \u201cPorcelain on Steel: Women of West Point\u2019s Long Gray Line,\u201d said about 50 women who had graduated from West Point were making the trip.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have been working on this for decades,\u201d she said, sounding ebullient. \u201cThere are thousands of servicewomen who are behind them.\u201d\n\nThe Army, because it is by far the biggest service, has the most jobs closed to women. But that is where the graduations of Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, who showed an officer\u2019s poise and command of the stage at her appearance on Thursday, will come into play: Their success will diminish most arguments against women holding other combat positions, defense officials say.\n\nEven the Navy SEAL teams appear prepared to accept women who could pass their training program, though many in the military consider it more rigorous than even Ranger School.\n\nOnly six Air Force job classes are currently closed to women \u2014 positions like air controllers who call in airstrikes from the front lines.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn Air Force spokeswoman, Capt. Brooke L. Brzozowske, said the Air Force had not made a final decision on what, if any, exceptions it would seek.\n\nThat leaves the Marines, widely seen as the most reluctant to fully integrate women. The Marines have not said what they plan to recommend to the defense secretary, but officials at the Pentagon are bracing for a fight.\n\nOne defense official said \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a lot of pushback\u201d from both sides \u2014 the Marines, many of whom argue that women cannot cut it physically; and Pentagon officials, who say that everything should be open and that exceptions should be granted only in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nSome critics have questioned whether the two female Ranger students received any breaks. Army instructors emphatically deny that, and say they met every requirement the men did.\n\nIn fact, they say the two women scored very high on performance assessments made by their fellow students, one of the most important evaluations, in which negative assessments can mean a quick exit from the school.\n\nSome other students even urged instructors to give the two women \u2014 and another female officer now retaking an intermediate segment of the course \u2014 another chance after they twice failed an early phase.\n\n\u201cAll three of these soldiers scored very high\u201c on peer assessments filed by other students, \u201cand for us that spoke volumes,\u201d said Command Sgt. Maj. Curtis Arnold, the top enlisted man in the training brigade that oversees Ranger School.\n\n\u201cYou got fellow students writing in on peers: \u2018Hey, they deserve another shot,\u2019 \u201d he said. Some of the other students were even more emphatic, saying they began the course very skeptical the women could make it but quickly realized how wrong they had been.\n\nSecond Lt. Zachary Hagner said his mind \u201ccompletely changed\u201d one day as he was growing weary of carrying a heavy machine gun, and others in his group would not help. But Captain Griest stepped in.\n\n\u201cNine guys were like, \u2018I\u2019m too broken, I\u2019m too tired.\u2019 She was just as broken and tired, and took it from me almost with excitement,\u201d Lieutenant Hagner said. \u201cI thought she was crazy for that.\u201d\n\nAnother second lieutenant, Michael V. Janowski, said he did not think he would have made it to graduation had it not been for a similar intervention by Lieutenant Haver.\n\n\u201cNo matter how bad she was hurting, she was always the first to volunteer to grab more weight,\u201d Lieutenant Janowski said. \u201cI wrote about how I would trust her with my life.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf32204235215b082e491"}}
