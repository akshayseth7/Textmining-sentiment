The most athletic thing he does, by far, is run between my legs when I\u2019m walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Servals bring a slightly more versatile skillset to the table.\n\nNative to sub-Saharan Africa, the long-legged wild cats are known to jump upward of 15 feet in the air, and are capable of catching birds in flight. The video above is pretty solid evidence of their jumping prowess.\n\nCaptured via GoPro by the Cincinnati Zoo, the serval in question, Jambo, shows off its hops by batting a ball held 10 feet above its head. It's an amazing show of animal athleticism that leaves but one question: Can he dunk?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daef0104235215b082e220"}}
