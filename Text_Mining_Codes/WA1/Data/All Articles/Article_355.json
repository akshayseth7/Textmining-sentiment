But few expected Xi\u2019s probe would take down a tiger quite as fierce as Zhou Yongkang, the former national security chief sentenced to life in prison today.\n\nThe former head of the ministry of public security and member of the Communist Party\u2019s top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, Zhou is the highest-ranking Chinese official jailed since the Mao era. Xinhua reports that Zhou is accused of accepting bribes worth about $21.3 million and abusing his power to enrich members of his family and his political allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis could all be true (the evidence against him has not been made public), but his conviction may have less to do with the charges than Zhou\u2019s ties to an influential faction of Xi\u2019s rivals in the country\u2019s senior leadership, a group that includes former President Jiang Zemin and former Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai, a once-rising star who was himself sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013.\n\nZhou\u2019s sentence may have been a statement, but the authorities\u2019 handling of the case was unexpectedly muted. The court had promised an open trial, and it was thought that Zhou\u2019s humiliation would be played out for maximum propaganda value\u2014as with other officials accused of corruption, the public reaction to Zhou\u2019s downfall has been mostly positive. But the trial ended up being held behind closed doors in May and the verdict was announced Thursday without any public warning. Zhou was shown on state TV, pleading guilty and confessing to the \u201charm I\u2019ve caused to the party and the people,\u201d but it was only the fifth item on the evening news broadcast. It\u2019s possible Zhou may have known too many secrets and been a little too connected to people still in power for a high-profile public trial.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02504235215b082e2ba"}}
