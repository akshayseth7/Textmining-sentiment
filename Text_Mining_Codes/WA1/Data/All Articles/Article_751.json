The idea \u201clasted maybe six weeks.\u201d And yet:\n\nOne of the things that had put me in mind of adoption was a sense of alienation from the younger generation. They seemed politically not the way they should be as young people. I thought people were supposed to be idealistic and angry. And they seemed kind of cynical and not very angry. At least not in any way that was accessible to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHis New Yorker editor, Henry Finder, suggested that he \u201cmeet up with a group of new university graduates instead,\u201d the Guardian says, which turned out to be just the Gen-Y fix Franzen needed.\n\nNaturally, Twitter erupted (and Franzen's name began trending):\n\n@robdelaney some responsible adult needs to adopt Jonathan Franzen \u2014 Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) August 21, 2015\n\n\"Young Iraqi orphan considered allowing himself to be adopted by Franzen to figure out insufferable white men.\" \u2014 Alex Abad-Santos (@alex_abads) August 21, 2015\n\nFEED JONATHAN FRANZEN TO THE MACHINE.

In the Guardian interview, he also said, \u201cI\u2019m not a sexist. I am not somebody who goes around saying men are superior. \u2026 In fact, I really go out of my way to champion women\u2019s work that I think is not getting enough attention. None of that is ever enough. Because a villain is needed. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no way to make myself not male.\u201d His whole worldview seems so perfectly engineered to feed the Internet, and yet deploring the way the Internet works is one of his worldview\u2019s foundational principles. As Franzen told the Guardian, of his lightning-rod status: \u201cThere is really nothing I can do except die\u2014or, I suppose, retire and never write again.\u201d He continues to issue theatrically clueless public statements but never stops being successful, so jabbing at him\u2014as my colleague Willa Paskin pointed out\u2014never feels like punching down.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf23404235215b082e446"}}
