In it, the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s resident red river hog gets a very special birthday treat: a smorgasbord of fruit-centric delicacies fit for an aging pig.\n\nThe 7-year-old hog\u2014aptly named Sir Francis (after Bacon, one assumes, not Drake)\u2014quickly devours the feast, with appropriately joy-filled noises indicating his approval. The whole scene proves a universal truth once and for all: You will never be as happy as a pig on his birthday, eating a platter of messy, borderline disgusting slop.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf21a04235215b082e431"}}
