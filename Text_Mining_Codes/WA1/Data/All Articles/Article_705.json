Donald Trump isn\u2019t threatening to round up Irish immigrants in Boston who entered the country illegally or to build a wall between us and Canada; he\u2019s threatening Latinos and tapping into an ugly strain of racist nativism. It\u2019s why \u201canchor baby\u201d\u2014slang for the American-born children of unauthorized immigrants\u2014is such a charged term. To many, it\u2019s racial code for often brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking children.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.\n\nOf course, rhetoric aside, America\u2019s immigrant community goes beyond Latino and Hispanic Americans. It includes Africans, Europeans, and Asians, one of the fastest growing groups in the country. Not all Asians are tied to the immigrant experience\u2014more than a quarter are native-born, with long and durable ties to the United States. But the large majority are foreign-born, with roots in a variety of different countries, from China and Japan to Korea, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh. Moreover, they\u2019re a rising share of the electorate\u2014in 1996, just 1.6 percent of voters were Asian. In 2012, it was 3.4 percent. As second- and third-generation Asian Americans take the stage in national life, that voting block will increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Republicans attack immigration\u2014and increasingly, immigrants\u2014we know it alienates Hispanic and Latino voters. Indeed, between Trump and his chorus of imitators, the party has all but abandoned its outreach to that community. But in this analysis, we shouldn\u2019t ignore Asian Americans. This rhetoric matters to them too, and if Republicans aren\u2019t careful, they\u2019re set to lose two groups and likely seal their fate for next November.\n\nHow do we know that Asian voters care about immigration? Let\u2019s look back to the previous presidential election. So little of how Barack Obama won in 2012 was a surprise. He captured young voters and cleaned up with single women; he struck gold with Latinos and won the entire black vote, again; and he was weak, as expected, with most white Americans. However, there was one shock: Obama scored an enormous win among Asians. His 73 percent share of the Asian vote was a significant increase from the previous election and a bright spot in his overall performance.\n\nIt would have been one thing if, like blacks, Asians were Democratic stalwarts. But they weren\u2019t. A solid 44 percent supported George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, and a sizable minority\u201435 percent\u2014voted for John McCain in the 2008 election. The reason is straightforward: As a whole, Asians are closer to the social and economic mainstream than other minority groups. They are the \u201chighest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States,\u201d notes the Pew Research Center. \u201cThey are more satisfied than the general public with their lives, finances and the direction of the country, and they place more value than other Americans do on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Asians were primed to follow the national trend and vote a little more Republican. But they didn\u2019t. Just 26 percent voted for Mitt Romney, the lowest GOP total in 20 years. What happened? What turned a small Democratic edge into an outright advantage?\n\nAgain, the answer is immigration, and specifically, the sense of exclusion that came from the GOP. In the 2012 primary, like this one, Republicans were torn over immigration policy, with candidates having a strong incentive to oppose comprehensive reform. Throughout the primary process, candidates fought to surpass one another with draconian solutions for dealing with unauthorized immigrants, with Romney touting \u201cself-deportation\u201d in his pitch to Republican voters. He won the nomination, but the phrase was an albatross on his general election campaign. In a 2014 study, researchers at Vanderbilt University measured the impact of that rhetoric on Asian voters. How would they react to feeling excluded or questioned on their citizenship? \u201cThe simple intervention of making an Asian subject feel excluded with respect to \u2018Americanness\u2019 and being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen increased negative dispositions towards the Republican Party and increased positive views of the Democratic Party,\u201d write the authors. Put simply, when confronted with exclusionary rhetoric, Asian voters tied the Republican Party to racial discrimination.\n\nLast year, in the midterm elections, it looked like Republicans recovered from their 2012 rout with Asians. In exit polls, 50 percent voted for Democrats, versus 49 percent for Republicans. If that\u2019s accurate, then the picture isn\u2019t as bad as it seems. But there\u2019s always been a midterm swing toward Republicans, and several polls\u2014including in-language surveys from polling firm Asian American Decisions\u2014show a larger Democratic advantage than appears in that exit poll. Indeed, in its recent probe of party affiliation, Pew found an almost 3-to-1 divide among Asians: 65 percent identified with the Democratic Party, 23 percent with the GOP.\n\nStill, outreach isn\u2019t hopeless, especially in an open election year without an incumbent on the ballot. But that assumes that Republicans can get their base under control, or at least behind rhetoric that doesn\u2019t antagonize immigrant groups and those with ties to immigrant communities. This could happen, but because of Trump, it looks like a long shot. Trump isn\u2019t just popular; he\u2019s shaping Republican policy, and several candidates have even turned against birthright citizenship\u2014a historic achievement of the once\u2013party of Lincoln.\n\nMaybe this won\u2019t matter for 2016. After all, most Americans aren\u2019t paying attention to the race thus far. But that\u2019s small consolation. Democrats are watching the Republican primary. They are recording and polling and testing. Come next year, they will blanket immigrant communities with the greatest hits of Republican rhetoric, and over the course of the campaign, countless people\u2014teachers, factory workers, small business people, and others\u2014will remember the comments about \u201cillegals\u201d and \u201canchor babies.\u201d And they\u2019ll act accordingly. In turn, this will leave Republicans in a tight spot. To win without minorities, they\u2019ll have to find and mobilize even more white voters: men and women who aren\u2019t as tied to the political system, people who are angry and disaffected from their leaders. Trump supporters.\n\nOn Friday, a writer for the Federalist\u2014a conservative website\u2014asked if the GOP was the \u201cparty of freedom\u201d or the \u201cparty of white identity.\u201d If the party keeps moving on its present path, there will be no answer but the latter.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1d304235215b082e418"}}
