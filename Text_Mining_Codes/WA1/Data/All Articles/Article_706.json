However, the Fusion article he referred to said 80% of women crossing the Mexican border are raped along the way, often by criminal gangs, traffickers or corrupt officials.\n\nWhen CNN host Don Lemon pointed out that Trump had misread the article, the former Apprentice host said: \u201cWell, somebody\u2019s doing the raping, Don! I mean somebody\u2019s doing it! Who\u2019s doing the raping? Who\u2019s doing the raping?\u201d\n\nThere are no centrally recorded government statistics on the ethnicity of convicted rapists in the US.\n\nDepartment store Macy\u2019s on Wednesday became the fifth big company to have ended partnerships with Trump following his attack on Mexico for \u201csending people [to the US] that have lots of problems. They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and their rapists.\u201d\n\nTV networks NBC Universal, Grupo Televisa, Ora TV and Univision have already cut ties with Trump and the Miss Universe contest, which he part-owns. Mexico is refusing to send a contestant to Miss Universe this year because of the row.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from Mexico. We do not believe the disparaging characterizations portray an accurate picture of the many Mexicans, Mexican Americans and Latinos who have made so many valuable contributions to the success of our nation,\u201d Macy\u2019s said.\n\nTelevisa, Mexico\u2019s largest television network, said Trump has \u201coffended the entire Mexican population\u201d and Ora, which is owned by the world\u2019s second-richest man, Carlos Slim, described Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cracist\u201d.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1d404235215b082e419"}}
