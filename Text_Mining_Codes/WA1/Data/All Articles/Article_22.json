Steve and Scott Leader of South Boston are now being investigated under suspicion of living illegally in public housing. The Boston Globe explains:\n\nAfter their arrest, the Leader brothers told State Police that they lived in public housing, but records show that only their mother is listed as a resident. Housing officials said she now faces eviction proceedings.\n\nThe Boston Housing Authority requires lease holders to list all residents and to pay their fair share of the rent, because public housing is for needy families whose average income is $14,000 a year. Some 36,000 people are on the waiting list for housing. Police records say Scott is a mason and Steve, 30, is a carpenter.\n\n\u201cBased on the police report and other information, there\u2019s reason to believe that the Leader brothers were living at the Mary Ellen McCormack development illegally,\u201d Lydia Agro, the housing authority chief of staff, said Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nProsecutors have charged the brothers with multiple counts of assault, hate crimes, indecent exposure and making threats after they woke up a homeless man, punched him and urinated on his face. One of the brothers allegedly told police it was OK to do what they did because \u201cDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\u201d The victim, a 58-year-old Mexican immigrant, has apparently lived in the United States since the 1980s and is recovering from his injuries.\n\n\u201cHis spirit is good. He\u2019s a man with a huge heart,\u201d Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez Joseph, the consul general of Mexico in Boston, tells the Boston Globe. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t seem to hold any anger or grudge. He simply expressed concern that it doesn\u2019t happen to anybody else.\u201d\n\nTrump condemned the attack on Friday, writing on Twitter that he would never condone violence. The real estate mogul had come under much criticism for how he responded to attack earlier in the week. Saying he hadn\u2019t heard of the incident, Trump said \u201cit would be a shame\u201d before adding that \u201cpeople who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daee1a04235215b082e16e"}}
