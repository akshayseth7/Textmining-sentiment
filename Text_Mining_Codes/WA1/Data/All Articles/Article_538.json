Drinking water in Tianjin met national standards, they said.\n\nOfficials have confirmed that the warehouse at the centre of the explosions, owned by Rui Hai International Logistics, stored 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide among hundreds of tonnes of other toxic chemicals.\n\nPhoto shared on Chinese social media site Weibo showing dead fish in waters near the Tianjin blast site.\n\nSodium cyanide, a compound used in gold mining, can be toxic to humans even in small quantities.\n\nThe blasts on Wednesday last week killed at least 114 people, with another 65 listed as missing and presumed dead.\n\nCrowds of curious onlookers gathered on the banks of the Haihe River to take pictures of the grim scene of dead fish, as environmental activists took samples of the water.\n\nAnother photo shared on Chinese social media site Weibo showing the dead fish.\n\nTianjin, the world's 10th-busiest port, will relocate chemical plants from the Tianjin Binhai New Area where the blasts occurred to the Nangang Industrial Zone, 25 kilometres away, according to the official China Daily, citing Tianjin mayor Huang Xingguo\u200b.\n\nThe Communist party's anti-graft watchdog promised to crack down both on corruption and on those responsible for violating laws and regulations which had led to the explosions but stressed the importance of maintaining political stability, according to a statement on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection website on Thursday.\n\nWith Reuters\n\nAn activist takes a sample of water from a river where dead fish have began appearing near the Tianjin blast site.
