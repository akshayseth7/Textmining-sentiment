Assuming they both survive, they would be 17-year-old Mei Xiang\u2019s third and fourth living offspring. \u201cAll of us are thrilled that Mei Xiang has given birth,\u201d the zoo\u2019s director, Dennis Kelly, said. \u201cWe know Mei is an excellent mother.\u201d And thus begins \u201ca fresh and not totally unexpected chapter in the public romance with the rotund black-and-white bears that have enthralled Washington and legions of panda fanatics for 43 years,\u201d notes the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in close communication with veterinarians, the scientists, keepers. Everybody\u2019s extremely happy,\u201d Pamela Baker-Masson, the zoo\u2019s spokeswoman, said. \u201cWe were all tuned in to the panda cam, and we saw her water break. And then just about an hour later \u2026 she gave birth to a cub.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe second cub that came five hours later wasn\u2019t completely unexpected. Giant pandas give birth to twins about half the time, and when asked about the possibility, the zoo\u2019s chief veterinarian said that during an ultrasound earlier in the week he saw \u201ctwo areas that made me excited.\u201d For now, zoo authorities seem cautiously optimistic. Although everything seems to be going well, it\u2019s a \u201cvery fragile time,\u201d as Kelly put it, for the pink, hairless, and blind cubs that weigh three to five ounces. In 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub that died after six days, notes the Associated Press.\n\nStaff at the zoo are helping Mei Xiang with her twins, occasionally taking one of the cubs and keeping it in an incubator after it became clear she was having trouble picking them both up at the same time, reports Reuters. On Sunday morning, the National Zoo posted a video of the first vet exam carried out on one of the cubs: \u201cThis cub is vocalizing well & appears strong.\u201d\n\nEven if all goes well for the cubs though, it\u2019s likely to be months before panda fans will be able to see them in person. For now, the live cams will have to do.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf17004235215b082e3c6"}}
