There have been two major theories about why the government decided to make this sudden turnabout. The first is that the Communist Party is desperate to speed up the country\u2019s slowing growth , and thinks that devaluing the currency will help by reviving Chinese exports, which fell a painful 8.3 percent in July . The cheaper the yuan is, the more made-in-China televisions and T-shirts Americans can afford to buy.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s how things worked until Tuesday, when the central bank made its big move . It set the midpoint a full 1.8 percent lower, and said that, from now on, it would fix the number based on where trading closed they day before. The goal was to move toward a \u201cmore market-determined exchange rate.\u201d And the market has dragged it down each day since.\n\nSome background: Since 2005, when China broke its currency\u2019s official peg to the dollar, the People\u2019s Bank of China has carefully controlled the yuan by setting its value against the greenback every morning, and letting it trade in a small band above or below that mark. No matter what the market has done, the government got to decide how high it wanted the midpoint to be. Usually it only let that magic number move a fraction of a percent each day.\n\nThis is all a bit much. While nobody can be 100 percent sure about China\u2019s intentions, labeling it garden-variety \u201cmanipulation\u201d isn\u2019t an especially helpful way to think about what\u2019s going on. At the very worst, China seems to be letting the market do its dirty work for it.\n\n\u201cChina has manipulated its currency for a long time,\u201d said Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley. \u201cThis is just the latest example, and it\u2019s past the time to do something about it.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the world\u2019s most morose presidential candidate, called China\u2019s act \u201cjust the latest in a long history of cheating.\u201d Democrats also piled on, with Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania urging the Treasury Department to officially label China a currency manipulator, a move it has long resisted. Of course, lumpen demagogue Donald Trump offered the most quotable line, when he explained during a campaign appearance that \u201cDevalue means suck the blood out of the United States!\u201d\n\nSo it hasn\u2019t been surprising to once again see lawmakers cry \u201cmanipulation\u201d ever since China unexpectedly devalued the yuan on Tuesday. The move led to the currency\u2019s biggest one-day drop since 1994, as well as two more days of decline, leaving much of the financial world in a state of mild panic and American politicians in a froth.\n\nAmericans have long been conditioned to mentally tack on the phrase currency manipulator whenever they hear the word China. In the story told by U.S. politicians , the People\u2019s Republic has nefariously held down the value of its money in order to make its manufactured goods cheaper overseas and steal jobs from the West. The trope may be oversimplified and outdated\u2014China\u2019s government has allowed the yuan (otherwise known as the renminbi, or RMB, or the redback) to gradually appreciate against the dollar for the better part of 10 years \u2014but it\u2019s notably persistent.\n\nThe second theory is a little less obvious, but might actually make more sense in the end: China wants the yuan to become one of the world\u2019s reserve currencies, which would give the country even more enormous economic sway over the long term and lead to a new influx of investment; what we\u2019re seeing now, the argument goes, is China messily attempting to make that happen. At the moment, the International Monetary Fund is considering whether to add the yuan to the basket of currencies that make up its Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, which as of now includes the American dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling. If the yuan were added to that list, it would be the equivalent of a massive gold star signaling to the rest of the world that yes, China\u2019s money is safe to treat as a reserve asset.\n\nThe IMF will meet in November to decide which countries to let into the SDR club, a review it undertakes once every five years. Meanwhile, the fund released a report this month that praised some of China\u2019s financial reforms, but said (in so many words) that, in order to be included in the SDR, the country would need a more market-based exchange rate. That may help explain the sudden timing of China\u2019s big currency move, which, not coincidentally, the IMF called \u201ca welcome step.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible, as Neil Irwin has argued at the New York Times, that China saw an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: It could please the IMF by letting the market have more influence over the yuan while also cheapening its currency to goose exports. It\u2019s also possible that China\u2019s leaders have wanted to make this change for a while, and perhaps thought it would be politically easier to do it when it had a chance of helping Chinese companies sell more stuff abroad. Either way, \u201cmanipulation\u201d is a weird way to frame this issue, because in the end, it\u2019s about letting the market have some say.\n\nIt\u2019s also not crazy to think that the yuan may have been a bit overvalued before Tuesday. China has largely pegged its value to the dollar, and the dollar has been on a massive rise. The yuan in turn has \u201chitched a ride,\u201d as the Economist put it, appreciating against currencies like the euro even as China\u2019s trade situation and economy hit the rocks. In May the IMF concluded that the yuan was no longer undervalued. By now, it might well be overpriced.\n\nThere are other reasons to doubt that China has devalued its currency simply to bring exports back to life. Namely, it could backfire. The more China\u2019s currency falls, the weaker its economy will look, which could dissuade foreign investors from putting their money into the country and even convince wealthy Chinese to move their cash elsewhere. Already, it looks like the latter is starting to happen. Chinese companies have also borrowed a great deal of dollar-denominated debt, which is now going to be more expensive to pay off.\n\nChina also seems to be doing its best to prevent its currency from falling too precipitously. So far, it\u2019s down only about 3 percent since the central bank\u2019s policy change\u2014which, from the point of view of increasing exports, isn\u2019t a lot\u2014in part because the government seems to have intervened a bit by selling dollars to prop up the yuan. Those efforts undercut the idea that the new exchange rate will be entirely market-driven, but it\u2019s also not an entirely uncommon move. Meanwhile, the central bank gave a rare press conference earlier Thursday in which it dismissed rumors that it was trying to slowly pull off a 10 percent devaluation and said it expected the yuan\u2019s value would begin to climb again. You might be tempted to dismiss that as talk, but when a central bank puts its word on the line like that, it typically needs to do its best to follow through. Otherwise, the rest of the world is less likely to trust the money it prints as, say, a reserve currency. And that trust is exactly what China hopes to cement right now.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0ee04235215b082e37f"}}
