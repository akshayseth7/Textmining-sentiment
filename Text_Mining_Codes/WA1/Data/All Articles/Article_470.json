The speech presented an expansive yet detailed argument not only for reducing the number of people serving time in prison, but for changing the way prison time is spent so that individuals return to society better-equipped to succeed.\n\nLeon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer.\n\nThe speech, delivered in Philadelphia at the annual conference of the NAACP, comes one day after the president commuted the sentences of 46 nonviolent drug offenders serving time in federal prison, and one day before a scheduled visit to a federal prison in Oklahoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe speech was wide-ranging\u2014Obama said he wanted to talk about proposals \u201cin the community, in the courtroom, and in the cellblock\u201d\u2014but was built upon a basic thesis, that the American criminal justice system \u201cis not as fair as it should be,\u201d and that \u201cwhile the people in our prisons have made some mistakes, and sometimes big mistakes, they are also Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cMass incarceration makes our country worse off,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nObama emphasized the disproportionate effect that the past 30 years of criminal justice have had on black and Hispanic Americans, noting that they make up 30 percent of the general population but roughly 60 percent of the incarcerated population. He also called for reinvestment in underprivileged communities, making the argument that unless money is spent on creating opportunities for people who might otherwise resort to crime, justice reform will only go so far.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ask our police, or our prosecutors, or our prison guards, or our judges to bear the entire burden of containing and controlling problems that the rest of us are not facing up to and aren\u2019t willing to do something about,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cToday I\u2019ve been talking about the criminal justice system, but we have to recognize that it\u2019s not something that we can view in isolation. Any system that allows us to turn a blind eye to hopelessness and despair\u2014that\u2019s not a justice system. It\u2019s an injustice system. But that\u2019s an extension and a reflection of some broader decisions that we\u2019re making as a society. And that has to change.\u201d\n\nThe speech broke at least two pieces of news. First, the president expressed full-throated support for re-enfranchising convicted felons who have served their time. \u201cIf folks have served their time, and they\u2019ve re-entered society, they should be able to vote,\u201d he said, to loud applause. Such a change would affect approximately 4 million people around the country who currently cannot vote because of their criminal records, even though they are no longer incarcerated.\n\nSecond, Obama called for prisons around the country to take a hard look at the use of solitary confinement and revealed that he had asked Attorney General Loretta Lynch to \u201cstart a review of the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.\u201d (On the official POTUS Twitter, Obama was quoted in a way that made clear the attorney general would only be looking at federal prisons.)\n\n\u201cThe social science shows that an environment like that is often more likely to make inmates more alienated, more hostile, more violent,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDo we really think it makes sense to lock so many people alone in tiny cells for 23 hours a day for months, sometimes for years, at a time? That is not going to make us safer. That\u2019s not going to make us stronger. And if those individuals are ultimately released, how are they ever going to adapt? It\u2019s not smart. Our prisons should be a place where we can train people for skills that can help them find a job, not train them to become more hardened criminals.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the speech, the president sounded a personal note, echoing a comment he made after the death of Trayvon Martin.
