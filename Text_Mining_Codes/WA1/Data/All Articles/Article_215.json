Is it as lousy as everyone says it is? What is its relationship to the characters and themes of its well-loved predecessor? Finally, should this publishing thunderbolt change the way we think about To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019s place in the canon?\n\nNext month the Audio Book Club will dig into Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 Between the World and Me. Read the book and stay tuned for our discussion in September!\n\nVisit our Audio Book Club archive page for a complete list of the more than 75 books we\u2019ve discussed over the years.
