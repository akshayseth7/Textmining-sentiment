Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.\n\nIn a setup that would not look out of place in fiction, Jonathan Franzen, the bestselling American novelist, has said he once considered adopting an Iraqi war orphan to help him understand young people better, but was persuaded against it by his editor.\n\nFranzen said he was in his late 40s at the time with a thriving career and a good relationship but he felt angry with the younger generation. \u201cOh, it was insane, the idea that Kathy [his partner] and I were going to adopt an Iraqi war orphan. The whole idea lasted maybe six weeks.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOne of the things that had put me in mind of adoption was a sense of alienation from the younger generation. They seemed politically not the way they should be as young people. I thought people were supposed to be idealistic and angry. And they seemed kind of cynical and not very angry. At least not in any way that was accessible to me.\u201d\n\nInstead, Henry Finder, his editor at the New Yorker, suggested he meet up with a group of new university graduates. \u201cIt cured me of my anger at young people,\u201d Franzen said.\n\nRelated: Jonathan Franzen interview: \u2018There is no way to make myself not male'\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Weekend magazine, the 56-year-old also said he believed he had been assigned the role of an anti-women villain by certain feminist critics, adding of the attacks he said he had been subjected to: \u201cThere is really nothing I can do except die \u2013 or, I suppose, retire and never write again.\u201d\n\nThe author of critically acclaimed novels including The Corrections and Freedom, Franzen has become a figurehead of sorts for the literary world\u2019s struggle to address gender bias, and a lightning rod for criticism. A piece this week on the lifestyle website Bustle asks: \u201cIs Jonathan Franzen sexist?\u201d It highlights \u201cfive times he\u2019s made questionable comments about women\u201d.\n\nSuch criticism is nothing new for Franzen. When his novel Freedom received a glowing review in the New York Times in 2010, the novelist Jodi Picoult tweeted: \u201cWould love to see the NYT rave about authors who aren\u2019t white male literary darlings.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jodi Picoult (@jodipicoult) NYT raved about Franzen's new book. Is anyone shocked? Would love to see the NYT rave about authors who aren't white male literary darlings.\n\nBut he insisted: \u201cI\u2019m not a sexist. I am not somebody who goes around saying men are superior, or that male writers are superior. In fact, I really go out of my way to champion women\u2019s work that I think is not getting enough attention. None of that is ever enough. Because a villain is needed. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no way to make myself not male.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about a character in his forthcoming novel, Purity \u2013 a fanatical feminist who, among other things, forces her husband to urinate sitting down on the toilet to atone for his maleness \u2013 Franzen predicted that she would enrage his critics; in fact, she already has. \u201cAfter all these years we finally get to read a man\u2019s take on feminism,\u201d tweeted the Canadian writer Anne Th\u00e9riault. \u201cBless you and the hard work you do, Mr Franzen.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Anne Th\u00e9riault (@anne_theriault) AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WE FINALLY GET TO READ A MAN'S TAKE ON FEMINISM BLESS YOU AND THE HARD WORK YOU DO, MR FRANZEN pic.twitter.com/2bK0okClFA\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of glee in putting that stuff in the book,\u201d Franzen told the Guardian. \u201cBecause I know that if you are hostile, you will find ammunition. I wrote this deliriously praising celebration of Edith Wharton. People managed to find a way to make it sound like I was hating on Edith Wharton. So why not just let it all rip and [say]: \u2018Have fun with that, guys.\u2019\u201d\n\nFranzen\u2019s appreciation of Wharton for the New Yorker saw him point out at one stage that she \u201cwasn\u2019t pretty\u201d. The novelist Victoria Patterson attacked the essay in the LA Review of Books, saying Franzen had \u201ctaken a literary hero and written about her as if ranking a Maxim photo spread\u201d.\n\nFranzen does not shy away from other topics that have proved controversial for him in the past, including his rift with Oprah Winfrey in 2001, which saw the chat show host uninvite the award-winning author from her book club after he said the \u201cschmaltzy, one-dimensional\u201d novels she championed made him cringe.\n\nRelated: Jonathan Franzen on his misanthropic reputation: 'We live in a world of cant'\n\nWhile the novelist blamed himself for the incident, he admitted he also blamed Winfrey. He said: \u201cBecause, from our very first conversation, it was clear we were not speaking the same language. I didn\u2019t scream when she called me. I said: \u2018Oh, hey,\u2019 and was trying to talk like a media professional to a media professional. And she didn\u2019t know what to do with that.\n\n\u201cWhat is the one thing a competition winner has to do? They have to show abject gratitude. And I was, like, well, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be doing this if it weren\u2019t good for you, too. So let\u2019s work together. And the answer was no. So I blame her, too.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think the fact that I was a white guy made that harder. And I think she was sensitive to any suggestion that I might be dissing her. And, of course, then I did diss her. But not before I\u2019d had that experience.\u201d\n\nFranzen\u2019s Guardian interview prompted swift response from writer Jennifer Weiner, who in a series of tweets, said: \u201cFrantzen believes he\u2019s locked in a no-win situation, he promotes women writers! And still we hate! \u2018Because a villain is needed.\u2019 WELL.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Weiner (@jenniferweiner) 3. Franzen believes he's locked in a no-win situation. He promotes women writers! And still we hate! \"Because a villain is needed.\" WELL.\n\nShe continued: \u201cYes, Franzen promotes women writers, in the New Yorker, and elsewhere. (Not on social media, though \u2013 which might help their books sell).\u201d\n\nShe accused him of hating her \u201cwithout, of course, deigning to read a word I\u2019ve written\u201d.\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Weiner (@jenniferweiner) 8. Instead, who does Franzen hate? @jodipicoult. Oprah. @michikokakutani. Me. (Without, of course, deigning to read a word I've written).\n\nShe added: \u201cThen he whines, \u2018It\u2019s like there\u2019s no way to make myself not male.\u2019 Well. We don\u2019t want Franzen unmanned. Just not Franzen unfair. Fin.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jennifer Weiner (@jenniferweiner) 10. Then he whines, \"It\u2019s like there\u2019s no way to make myself not male.\u201d Well. We don't want Franzen unmanned. Just not Franzen unfair. Fin.\n\nPurity, which is out on 1 September and which sees the young Pip Tyler becoming involved with a Julian Assange-like leader of a rival to WikiLeaks, takes on another bete noire of Franzen\u2019s: the internet. The author has previously said he does not go online when writing, and has described Twitter as \u201cunspeakably irritating\u201d.\n\n\n\nFranzen told the Guardian social media \u201cfeels like a protection racket\u201d. He said: \u201cYour reputation will be murdered unless you join in this thing that is, in significant part, about murdering reputations. Why would I want to feed that machine?\u201d\n\nHe also spoke of his concerns about how it will affect writers. \u201cThe ways in which self-censorship operates \u2013 the fear of being called a bad name \u2013 people become very careful. And it becomes very hard to be creative, actually. Because you\u2019re worried about what you might be called, and whether it\u2019s fair or not.\n\n\u201cThere used to be rather serious firewalls between the artist and the buying public \u2013 the gallery, the publisher. And technology demolishes that wall and basically says: self-promote or die. And that is a bad head for any sort of artist to be forced into.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Read Emma Brockes\u2019s full interview with Jonathan Franzen here.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf30304235215b082e477"}}
