He\u2019s given 1,168 rides with Uber, the complaint says.\n\nIn another case cited by the complaint, a driver had been convicted of the felony of \u201ccommitting lewd or lascivious acts against a child under 14,\u201d which didn\u2019t turn up on the background check. He\u2019s given \u201c5,697 rides to Uber passengers, including unaccompanied children,\u201d says the complaint.\n\nAnother driver was convicted of felony kidnapping for ransom with a firearm. The complaint listed other incidents in this driver\u2019s criminal history, including felony robbery with a firearm, selling cocaine, and DUIs in southern California. In fact, several of the drivers listed in the complaint have DUIs.\n\nMost of the rest are convicted of less severe, non-violent crimes, including \u201cfiling a forged power of attorney and filing a forged real estate grant deed,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nPerhaps most ironic: One driver received a citation at Los Angeles International Airport for driving with an expired license, and the driver \u201cstated that he was leasing his car from someone else and using their Uber account,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nMeanwhile, Uber has long maintained that its background check system is comprehensive and keeps consumers safe. It used to say that it was \u201cindustry-leading,\u201d but doesn\u2019t any more.\n\n\u201cA lot of the information that Uber has presented to consumers has been false and misleading,\u201d San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a press conference today, per an SFGate report.\n\nLast December, the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco filed a joint civil suit saying that the car-ride service was misleading consumers with its claims of in-depth driver vetting.\n\nThe service\u2019s background checks only go back seven years (as do competitor Lyft\u2019s), and simply aren\u2019t in-depth enough to catch everybody\u2019s histories, says the complaint.\n\nThe city of San Francisco is urging Uber and its ilk to use the Livescan, fingerprint-based method instead, but Uber is resisting.\n\n\u201cWe disagree that the Livescan process used by taxi companies is an inherently better system for screening drivers than our background checks,\u201d Uber said in a statement to SFGate. \u201cThe reality is that neither is 100% foolproof.\u201d\n\nNot so long ago, Lyft had to pay $250,000 in fines for a similar court finding, but didn\u2019t change anything about its background check processes.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf19d04235215b082e3e7"}}
