TOBY MELVILLE / Reuters\n\nVisitors to the event, put on in a disused swimming pool, can have a souvenir photo taken in Cinderella's Castle against a backdrop of a dead princess in a coach crash, while surly stewards carry bunches of balloons labelled \"I'm an imbecile.\"\n\n\"It's not a swipe at Disney. I banned any imagery of Mickey Mouse from the site.\"\n\nBanksy, whose identity has never been revealed, described it as \"a festival of art, amusements and entry-level anarchism.\"\n\n\"It's not a swipe at Disney,\" he said in a press release. \"I banned any imagery of Mickey Mouse from the site. It's a showcase for the best line-up of artists I could imagine, apart from the two who turned me down.\"\n\nThe site, whose signage bares more than a passing resemblance to Disneyland, is full of the artist's subversive statements and epigrams on Western culture, the media, capitalism and extreme disparities of wealth.\n\nPhoto Gallery: Banksy's Ironic 'Bemusement Park' Opens in England\n\nA model pensioner is engulfed in seagulls, a reference to a media panic about how aggressive birds had become this summer, while the merry-go-round horse, destined to become lasagne, harks back to a food scandal sparked by the presence of horsemeat in supermarket ready meals.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed 0:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nBanksy's works, which have been stenciled on locations ranging from London and New York to the West Bank and Gaza, have become highly sought after in the art world he satirizes.\n\nCollectors, who include pop star Christina Aguilera and actor Brad Pitt, have paid as much as $500,000 for pieces of his work.\n\nLocal authorities, who routinely had his graffiti painted over a decade ago, also now recognize the value. The local North Somerset Council said it was behind \"Dismaland\", mindful of a show in nearby Bristol that attracted more than 300,000 fans from around the world in 2009.\n\n\"We were absolutely delighted to have the biggest drawing name in art here,\" council leader Nigel Ashton told Reuters at a press preview.\n\nAshton, who is a member of Britain's ruling Conservatives, was not put off by any anti-authority theme. \"There's nothing wrong with asking provocative questions,\" he said.\n\nBanksy, who reportedly grew up in Bristol and started daubing buildings in the early '90s, could not be spotted at the press launch.\n\nA steward is seen outside Bansky's 'Dismaland' exhibition.
