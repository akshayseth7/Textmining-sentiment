Next to the quicksilver fluidity of mercury, it is gray, solid, and dense. Judged against rigid iron, it melts and bends easily. Compared with the homicidal efficiency of white arsenic, it takes spoonfuls of black lead powder to off a victim\u2014who would definitely notice the sweet taste.\n\nSo why is humble lead even a criminal suspect, especially when it\u2019s done everything we\u2019ve asked? For the past 6,000 years, lead has been vital to civilization\u2014from lead pipes that brought clean water to thousands in Rome to lead batteries that power millions of cars. In 2014 alone, we used 11.3 million tons worldwide\u2014about 3.4 pounds for each person on the planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeef304235215b082e214"}}
