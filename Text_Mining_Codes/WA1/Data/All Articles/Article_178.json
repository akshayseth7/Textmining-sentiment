From the Boston Globe:\n\nPolice said Scott Leader, 38, told them it was OK to assault the man because he was Hispanic and homeless.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\u201d he allegedly told the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(It's not clear whether the victim of the assault is actually an undocumented immigrant.)\n\n\n\nLeader's brother Steve is the other suspect. The brothers say the Hispanic man threatened them, but a prosecutor described the attack as \"unprovoked\" and the man reportedly told police that he was woken from sleep because the two brothers were urinating on his face. He suffered a broken nose and was reportedly struck several times in the head area with a metal pole.\n\nThe Globe reached Trump for comment:\n\n\n\nTrump, told of the alleged assault, said \u201cit would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeee004235215b082e208"}}
