It is the inspiration of Sean Mulryan, chairman and founder of developer Ballymore. Next month, the group will unveil Legacy Buildings, the second phase of the scheme.Using eight-inch-thick glass, the so-called \u201csky pool\u201d appears to float in the air and resembles a giant aquarium.It will be for the private use of residents, who will be able to swim from one building to the next and enjoy a dramatic vista of the Palace of Westminster and the London Eye. The linked sky deck at the top of the two buildings will have a summer bar and sun loungers, a spa and orangery.\u201cWe set out to create places and spaces that are more than just bricks and mortar,\u201d says Mulryan. \u201cThe pool is testimony to this philosophy and gives the development a unique character.\u201dApartments go on sale in September. Prices from \u00a3602,000. Call 020 7062 8940 for more information.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daeeb604235215b082e1e1"}}
