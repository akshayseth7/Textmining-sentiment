The major difference being that the baby red pandas unsurprisingly endure them with much more cuteness (and, hopefully, lower blood-pressure results). For proof, look no further than the video above , in which two young cubs undergo their first medical examination at the Cincinnati Zoo .\n\nIf the image of two pocket-sized red pandas squirming in the hands of their examiners isn\u2019t enough adorableness to fill your Friday quota, then the high-pitched squeaking they emit when they face down the stethoscope should do it. Not too dissimilar from that of an aging blogger, come to think of it, just less weird.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf0c204235215b082e347"}}
