You can\u2019t admit that public assistance is good for people or that the Iraq war was a mistake. You\u2019re supposed to pretend that single-payer health care is socialism, that we could balance the budget by cutting pork, and that with a little more backbone, we could make Iran utterly capitulate. But with 17 candidates running for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, somebody, now and then, is bound to blurt out the truth. That\u2019s what happened in Thursday night\u2019s debates. Here are some of the heresies that slipped out.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\n1. The Iraq war was a mistake. Jeb Bush has waffled on this, but on Thursday he decisively bit the bullet. He said he had equivocated because \u201cit was difficult for me\u201d after talking to families of dead soldiers who believed that their loved ones \u201cdid not die in vain.\u201d But Bush concluded: \u201cKnowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n2. We created ISIS. Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier challenged Sen. Rand Paul for having \u201cblamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.\u201d Baier quoted Paul\u2019s criticism of the hawks: \u201cEverything they\u2019ve talked about in foreign policy, they\u2019ve been wrong for the last 20 years.\u201d In the debate, Paul stipulated that ISIS was solely responsible for its atrocities. But he also blasted \u201cRepublicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. Humvees. \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t fund our enemies.\u201d\n\n3. We couldn\u2019t sustain international sanctions on Iran. Nearly all the Republicans have maintained the proud fiction that if Congress were to reject the nuclear agreement with Iran, or if the next president were to renounce it, we could stiffen the world\u2019s resolve and get a better deal. As Gov. Scott Walker put it in the prime-time debate: \u201cYou terminate the deal on Day One, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.\u201d But in the undercard debate, Carly Fiorina confessed the truth: \u201cI hope Congress says no to this deal. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. The Europeans have moved on.\u201d That\u2019s the unpleasant reality: We got as good a deal as we could, given the difficulties of our coalition.\n\nThe Republican Party isn\u2019t willing to nominate someone who\u2019s open to reality on most of these issues.\n\n4. You can\u2019t cut the deficit without cutting entitlements. Republicans love to pretend they can balance the budget by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. Paul\u2019s favorite target, for instance, is origami condoms. But on Thursday night, Gov. Chris Christie rebuked his colleagues with some basic math. \u201cSeventy-one percent of federal spending right now is on entitlement and debt service,\u201d said Christie. \u201cWe have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29 percent and no time on the 71 percent, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security.\u201d When Mike Huckabee replied that Congress should cut its own retirement program instead, Christie retorted, \u201cWe can't fix the problem just by ending Congress\u2019 retirement.\u201d Gesturing to show how meager the savings would be, Christie scoffed, \u201cThat\u2019s worth about this much.\u201d\n\n5. People need Social Security. Economic stratification and wage stagnation have made several Republicans surprisingly vocal about defending checks from the government. \u201cHalf of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham observed in Thursday\u2019s undercard debate. In the prime-time debate, Huckabee chimed in: \u201cSixty million Americans are on Social Security\u201460 million. A third of those people depend on 90 percent of their income from Social Security.\u201d Huckabee complained that politicians in both parties try to balance the books \u201coff the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money.\u201d", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf09e04235215b082e323"}}
