The dead fish have sparked fears of contamination despite government reassurances.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the fish: Water tests near the blast site show high levels of sodium cyanide, an extremely toxic chemical, and heavy rains earlier this week spread ominous looking white foam on roads near the site. Local officials are investigating the fish incident but say there was no cyanide in the river where the fish washed up and that the area\u2019s drinking water is safe. The head of Tianjin\u2019s environmental monitoring bureau told reporters that fish die-offs are \u201cnot rare\u201d during the summer due to changes in the water\u2019s salinity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe public doesn\u2019t seem to be buying it. Commenters on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, have suggested sarcastically that the fish were killed by \u201cclinical depression,\u201d \u201csuicide by drowning,\u201d or \u201cthe lies of this country.\u201d One suggested that local officials \u201ctake the lead and sample some of the fresh fish filets to set the record straight!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear what caused the explosion that devastated a large section of China\u2019s fourth-largest city, and public anger has been growing, with displaced families protesting to demand compensation. At least one staff member at the port where the explosion took place has been arrested. It seems quite possible the public anger will benefit President Xi Jinping, as calls to crack down on companies playing fast and loose with safety could fuel support for his massive anti-corruption crackdown.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf33704235215b082e4a2"}}
