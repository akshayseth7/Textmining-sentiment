What makes this feat even more extraordinary is that the record Dibaba broke was nearly 22 years old and many people thought it would never fall.\n\nDibaba\u2019s time of 3:50.07 in Monaco last Friday\u2014beating China\u2019s Qu Yunxia\u2019s world record of 3:50.46\u2014was only the second time below 3:55 since 1997. It raises anew questions about the limits of male and female runners in the mile and the \u201cmetric mile,\u201d distances whose records, before Dibaba\u2019s breakthrough, had all been stuck since the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs Yunxia\u2019s time continued to endure record attempts year after year, some people grew skeptical about her unrivaled feat. It wasn\u2019t only Yunxia. Before last week, the four fastest 1,500 times were set by Chinese women between 1993 and 1997. These races are often cited as relics from an era of lax doping regulation. However, Dibaba\u2019s performance has brought the 3:50 1,500 back into the realm of believability. With it, we can once again speculate about the human limits for the mile and the \u201cmetric mile\u201d and consider with fresh eyes the new techniques Dibaba and other athletes are using to pursue these marks.\n\nAfter predictions in the 1990s that world records would continue to decrease indefinitely\u2014including one study in Nature concluding that women might eventually overtake men in some distance events\u2014most experts now agree that we may have reached our peak in many races. While it\u2019s not quite true that humans won\u2019t be able to go any faster in these events\u2014as proved by Dibaba\u2014we are very close to that limit.\n\nIn a 2005 study from the English Institute of Sport, professors Alan Nevill and Greg Whyte used data from previous records to predict the best possible times for most men\u2019s endurance races as well as for the women\u2019s 800 and 1,500. The researchers concluded that track world record times were peaking and athletes would soon stop running faster.\n\nA couple of his record estimates have been broken by fractions of a second since 2005 (including the women\u2019s 1,500), but Nevill stands by his overall conclusions. \u201cThe chances of the world record being broken becomes less and less as time goes on,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has taken over 20 years for it to actually go down, and they have only improved it by about 0.4 seconds. It will take that sort of time for it to be broken again.\u201d\n\nAccording to David Epstein, author of The Sports Gene, during the second half of the 20th century, track records were improved, on average, eight times each decade. But now, he says, \u201cwe are in a period of diminishing returns.\u201d\n\nThis is especially the case for mid-distance events; before Dibaba\u2019s run, the 1,500 and mile records were all at least 16 years old. \u201cI suspect that you can enhance performances in the shorter distances with the right sort of medications,\u201d Nevill said. \u201cThe middle and long distances are a bit more of pure events. Everyone has learned all of the tricks now.\u201d But even the 5k, 10k, and marathon records are approached or surpassed more often than the 1,500 and mile, especially for men.\n\nIn their paper, Nevill and Whyte found that male endurance records are within 1 percent to 3 percent of their predicted limits. While women may have just about run their fastest times in the 1,500, according to these projections, men might be able to race as fast as 3:23.1 in the 1,500 and 3:39.0 in the mile, improvements of about three to four seconds on the current world records. The men\u2019s marathon record is the only time that Nevill and Whyte analyzed, besides the women\u2019s 1,500, that runners have since broken. Nevill says the marathon record has the greatest potential to be improved upon. \u201cThere is so much variability in the courses, and it\u2019s such a long distance,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cI think it is silly to ever say a limit because there are always technological changes that can make a difference,\u201d Epstein told me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it is silly to say it is close to the limit.\u201d He believes that even if the limit is very, very near, the women\u2019s 1,500 might fall again and Dibaba might be the one to do it.\n\nWhile Epstein and Nevill are pretty convinced we are fast approaching our limits, there is something to be said for how competitive athletes view our record prospects. After her race, Dibaba told the BBC, \u201cWith the training I did in Barcelona, I knew I was going to break that record.\u201d\n\nSir Roger Bannister is also confident we will keep getting better. In 2014, 60 years after his historic 3:59.4 mile, Bannister predicted that humans are capable of running under 3:30. \u201cI\u2019ve said three and a half minutes was physiologically achievable but thought it would take a long time to do,\u201d Bannister told Athletics Weekly. \u201cSo there is no absolute point at which the record will be static. That is my view.\u201d It\u2019s also interesting to look at the fastest time in the other mile\u2014Mike Boit\u2019s 3:28 downhill run in 1983\u2014and consider Bannister\u2019s remarks in that light.\n\nIn his TED Talk \u201cAre Athletes Really Getting Faster, Better, Stronger?\u201d Epstein said that technology, improved training methods, and other factors allow records to continue to trend downward even as we approach the limits. In one particularly striking example, he explained that of the 1,314 men who had broken the four-minute mile by the end of 2013, only 530 would be able to do the same on a cinder track, the material on which Bannister competed.\n\n\u201cThe less room sport has for technological innovation, the more records slow down,\u201d Epstein told me.\n\nNowadays, cash rewards also play a role in driving down world records. Epstein explained that for the mile record to be broken there would probably need to be an added monetary incentive that isn\u2019t there right now.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf09d04235215b082e322"}}
