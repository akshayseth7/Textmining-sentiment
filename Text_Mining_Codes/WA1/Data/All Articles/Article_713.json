The numbers aren\u2019t clear but the campaign switched locations twice to end up in a stadium that can hold up to 40,000 people. ABC News says the stadium was \u201cabout half full\u201d when Trump began speaking. The campaign said there were about 30,000 people.\n\nNumbers aside, the Washington Post points out that the speech \u201cwas about more than showmanship,\u201d describing the location as \u201ccoolly strategic\u201d since it involves \u201can increasingly important early battleground in the Republican nominating contest.\u201d Plus, it was Trump's way of showing there is support for his candidacy across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, Trump centered much of his speech on illegal immigration and the need to build a wall. Trump fans expressed support for the real estate mogul\u2019s push to eliminate birthright citizenship in order to do away with so-called \u201canchor babies.\u201d \"It's not right that they are just coming in free will and having babies and they stay here,\" one supporter told AL.com. \"It's not right.\" Other supporters had other ideas:\n\nMobile resident Jim Sherota, clutching a vaporizer in one hand and wearing a t-shirt of conservative musician Ted Nugent, took it one step further.\n\n\"The way I see it they ought to make it a vacation spot,\" Sherota said. \"OK, you want to come to the border, $25 for a permit, you can shoot all the people you want that cross illegally.\"\n\nHe later clarified that his remarks were \"in jest.\"", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf1ff04235215b082e420"}}
