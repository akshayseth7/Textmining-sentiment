Well, maybe. Despite a few memorable moments of intense realism on the global stage, world leaders have essentially done nothing. Existential dread is fairly common among those who work on climate change on a daily basis.\n\nThat\u2019s the theme Esquire\u2019s John H. Richardson explored this week in a fascinating and frank discussion with Jason Box and other climate scientists. I\u2019ve had my own run-ins with climate change despair, and this article strikes me as a fascinating insight into the psychology of an increasingly apocalyptic science. You should read the whole thing, but here are some highlights. Richardson describes Box as \u201coddly detached from the things he\u2019s saying, laying out one horrible prediction after another without emotion, as if he were an anthropologist regarding the life cycle of a distant civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Box is unfeeling. In a photo caption, Richardson reveals the money quote highlighting Box\u2019s ever-present malaise: \u201cThe customary scientific role is to deal dispassionately with data, but Box says that \u2018the shit that\u2019s going down is testing my ability to block it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the face of all this, Box and his family relocated from the United States to Denmark. Richardson explains their decision:\n\nHis daughter is three and a half, and Denmark is a great place to be in an uncertain world\u2014there\u2019s plenty of water, a high-tech agriculture system, increasing adoption of wind power, and plenty of geographic distance from the coming upheavals. \u201cEspecially when you consider the beginning of the flood of desperate people from conflict and drought,\u201d he says, returning to his obsession with how profoundly changed our civilization will be.\n\nIn fact, Box often thinks about the profound planetary changes that are already underway:\n\nHis home state of Colorado isn\u2019t doing so great, either. \u201cThe forests are dying, and they will not return. The trees won\u2019t return to a warming climate. We\u2019re going to see megafires even more, that\u2019ll be the new one\u2014megafires until those forests are cleared.\u201d\n\nBut the real success of the Richardson piece is the way he depicts the internal struggle Box deals with on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m not letting it get to me. If I spend my energy on despair, I won\u2019t be thinking about opportunities to minimize the problem.\u201d\n\nHis insistence on this point is very unconvincing, especially given the solemnity that shrouds him like a dark coat. But the most interesting part is the insistence itself\u2014the desperate need not to be disturbed by something so disturbing.\n\nIn a moment of candor I hadn\u2019t seen before, Box revealed to Richardson that he\u2019s already preparing for the worst:\n\n\u201cIn Denmark,\u201d Box says, \u201cwe have the resilience, so I\u2019m not that worried about my daughter\u2019s livelihood going forward. But that doesn\u2019t stop me from strategizing about how to safeguard her future\u2014I\u2019ve been looking at property in Greenland. As a possible bug-out scenario.\u201d\n\nDespite what the Esquire article says, Box, whose work I have previously covered on Slate, is a bit of an outlier among climate scientists. Most of them aren\u2019t as willing to talk about the plausibility of nightmare scenarios. Still, his frankness on climate change is welcome.\n\nUltimately, what scientists are after is truth, even if that truth is personally devastating. For that reason, being a climate scientist is probably one of the most psychologically challenging jobs of the 21st century. As the Esquire article asks: How do you keep going when the end of human civilization is your day job?\n\nI reached out to a few well-known climate scientists for their reactions to the article.\n\nMichael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University meteorologist whom Richardson quotes, told me, \u201cI would emphasize that it isn\u2019t too late to act, despite the sense one might get from the article. Our only obstacle at present is willpower.\u201d When asked about how many climate scientists struggle with psychological dread over their studies, Mann said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how many of my colleagues reflect on the matter. But those who don\u2019t ought to. What we\u2019re studying and learning is more than just science. It has ramifications for the future of humanity and this planet.\u201d\n\nBy far the most engaging response was from Katharine Hayhoe, a rising star in the climate science community after her work engaging evangelical Christians on the issue was profiled in a Showtime documentary last year. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people on the planet for 2014.\n\nHayhoe now lives in Texas, precisely because of its climate vulnerability. Hayhoe said Texas\u2019 \u201cstrident political opposition to the reality\u201d makes it \u201cground zero for climate change,\u201d which her work embraces. \u201cIf I personally can make a difference, I feel like Texas is where I can do it.\u201d But she\u2019s quick to applaud Box\u2019s work and doesn\u2019t criticize his family\u2019s decision to relocate.", "_id": {"$oid": "55daf02c04235215b082e2c1"}}
